TITLE: Marketing & Agencies — IceMaker

HERO
Headline:
Stop shipping flat content. Ship experiences.

Subhead:
IceMaker turns decks, pages, case studies and product docs into interactive cinematic experiences — where a brand guide answers questions in real time, grounded in your approved source.

Primary CTA:
Start building

Secondary CTA:
Book a demo

PROBLEM
Heading:
Templates are everywhere. Attention is not.

Bullets:
- Prospects don’t read PDFs — they look for answers.
- Slide tools look polished but stay passive.
- Video avatars speak at people, not with them.

WHAT YOU CAN BUILD
Heading:
Interactive content that engages — and converts.

Use cases:
- Interactive product explainers
- Sales enablement “experiences” instead of decks
- Case studies people actually explore
- Pitch experiences with a brand persona that answers questions
- Customer onboarding journeys that reduce friction

AGENCY VALUE (if relevant)
Heading:
A premium deliverable clients can’t easily replicate.

Bullets:
- Higher perceived value than static collateral
- Faster production from existing materials
- Measurable engagement and questions asked
- White-label / client-friendly delivery (as plan feature or “available on Business”)

DIFFERENTIATORS (Marketing framing)
- Interactive guide grounded in your source (no hallucinated claims)
- Memory across scenes (keeps the narrative consistent)
- Scene-based pacing (feels cinematic, not slide-like)
- Publish by link or embed (share anywhere)
