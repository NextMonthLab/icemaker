PROJECT: IceMaker (Orbit removed). We now need to reframe the public marketing pages.

ROLE
You are a senior frontend engineer + product designer. Your job is to implement a clean marketing site structure for IceMaker with strong conversion copy, segment pages, a blog, and an enterprise-credible theme system.

CONTEXT
- This repo has been refactored: Orbit code removed. IceMaker remains.
- Do NOT reintroduce Orbit references anywhere.
- We need an MVP marketing site that converts Corporate L&D first, then Marketing/Agencies.
- We want: Homepage + Corporate Training page + Marketing/Agencies page + Blog (+ Blog post template).
- UK English spelling.

CRITICAL RULES
1) Do not break existing IceMaker app functionality. Marketing pages must sit alongside the product safely.
2) If the app has auth/app routes, keep them intact; marketing routes must be public.
3) Do not delete shared infrastructure; only add/modify marketing pages and styling.
4) Ensure nav links work. No dead links. No Orbit references.
5) Keep the site fast, readable, and premium. Avoid gimmicks.

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (MVP)
Routes:
- /               = Homepage (IceMaker)
- /corporate-training  = Corporate Training / L&D
- /marketing-agencies  = Marketing + Agencies
- /blog            = Blog index
- /blog/[slug]     = Blog post template (MD or JSON-driven)
Optional:
- /pricing         = simple pricing section or reuse existing pricing component if present
- /book-demo       = simple page or modal trigger (can link to email/calendar placeholder)

DESIGN/THEME TASK (IMPORTANT)
Create a simple theme token system that supports two “modes”:
- Default = Enterprise/L&D mode (trust, clarity)
- Accent = Creative/Agency mode (cinematic, premium)

Colour guidance:
- Base background: near-black OR deep charcoal (premium) OR clean off-white (enterprise). Choose ONE direction and apply consistently.
- L&D feel: trustworthy, calm, minimal contrast noise. Use one strong accent colour only.
- Agency feel: keep same base but allow richer accent gradients/hero treatments.

Recommended direction for IceMaker:
- Use a dark premium base (charcoal/near-black) with a single “electric” accent.
- Why: feels cinematic (IceMaker), but still enterprise-grade if typography + spacing is disciplined.

Theme tokens to define (names can vary):
- --bg, --surface, --text, --muted, --border
- --accent, --accent-2 (optional), --accent-soft
- --success, --warning, --danger
- Typography scale + max-width + spacing scale

Typography:
- Use a modern, readable sans (Inter / system-ui).
- Headings strong, minimal.
- Body text comfortable line-height.

UI patterns:
- Hero with 1-2 CTAs
- Proof / logos row (can be “Used by teams in…” as placeholder)
- Benefit cards
- Use-case blocks
- Trust & Control block (source-grounded, boundaries, audit trail)
- Pricing teaser
- FAQ
- Final CTA

DELIVERABLES
A) Implement the route structure above.
B) Implement shared MarketingLayout with header + footer.
C) Implement theme tokens and apply across marketing pages.
D) Update navigation: Product, Corporate Training, Marketing & Agencies, Pricing (optional), Blog, Book a demo.
E) Ensure “Search repo for Orbit” shows no public marketing references.

NEXT: After you scaffold the pages and theme, you will paste in the copy from prompts 2–4 exactly and wire the sections accordingly.
