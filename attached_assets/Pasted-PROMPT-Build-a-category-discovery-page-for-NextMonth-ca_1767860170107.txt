PROMPT: Build a category discovery page for NextMonth called “Smart Glasses” with an Orbit-powered audit, a premium deep-dive chat upgrade, and a clearly labelled “Surfaced Products” section at the bottom.

CONTEXT
You are building a NextMonth category discovery page that helps users learn about Smart Glasses, run a lightweight “audit” of their needs, and then either:
1) Continue free exploration, or
2) Upgrade to premium for deeper chat, saved briefs, and creator content tools.

IMPORTANT INTEGRITY RULE
There must be a clear separation between:
- Editorial content (facts, explanations, neutral guidance)
- Commercial content (surfaced products)
Paid placement must NEVER influence editorial recommendations.
The bottom section must be clearly labelled as “Surfaced Products” and each item must be labelled “Sponsored” if it is paid.

PAGE ROUTE
Create a page at:
- /smartglasses

PAGE GOALS
1) Educate: explain smart glasses simply, with structured sections and practical examples.
2) Guide: provide an “Audit” that maps a user to recommended use-cases and considerations.
3) Convert: offer a premium upgrade for deep chat, saved briefs, and creator tools.
4) Monetise ethically: include a bottom “Surfaced Products” section for paid placements, clearly labelled.

UI REQUIREMENTS
Build a modern, clean page with these sections:

1) Hero
- Title: “Smart Glasses”
- Subtitle: “Understand the tech, compare options, and stay ahead of what’s next.”
- Primary CTA button: “Start the Smart Glasses Audit”
- Secondary CTA button: “Explore what people are asking”
- Include a small trust note under CTAs:
  “Editorial guidance is neutral. Surfaced Products are clearly labelled.”

2) Quick explainer tiles (3 to 6 tiles)
- “What smart glasses are”
- “Best for creators”
- “Best for everyday use”
- “Privacy and etiquette”
- “Battery and comfort”
- “Price expectations”

3) The Audit (interactive)
A step-by-step audit widget that asks:
- Budget range: under £300, £300-£600, £600-£1,200, £1,200+
- Primary goal: content creation, fitness, commuting, work, accessibility, experimenting
- Must-have features: camera, open-ear audio, AR display, prescription support, long battery, lightweight
- Privacy comfort level: low, medium, high
- Phone ecosystem: iPhone, Android, mixed
- Optional: wear glasses already? yes/no

Audit output should generate:
- A short “Your profile” summary
- A list of “Top considerations”
- A list of “Likely best category fits” (not brand picks, category fits)
Examples of category fits:
- “Camera-first creator glasses”
- “Audio-first everyday glasses”
- “True AR display glasses”
- “Enterprise workflow glasses”
- “Accessibility and assistive glasses”

Under the audit output, show 2 CTAs:
- “Ask the Orbit about my results” (free, limited turns)
- “Unlock premium deep dive” (premium)

4) Trending questions section
A list of 8 to 12 questions people commonly ask about smart glasses.
Include a “Refresh” button which simulates updating the list from the backend.
Examples:
- “Are smart glasses worth it in 2026?”
- “Which smart glasses have the best camera?”
- “Can I wear them with prescription lenses?”
- “How do they handle privacy and recording?”
- “Do AR glasses work outdoors?”
- “What is the difference between smart glasses and AR glasses?”

5) Creator Mode teaser (ICE Maker)
A section describing creator features:
- “Turn questions into content”
- “Hook ideas, scripts, captions”
- “Comparison templates”
- “Posting plan”
CTA: “Unlock Creator Mode”

6) Premium value section
A pricing-style panel with benefits:
- Deep chat with memory for this category
- Save briefs and comparison packs
- Creator Mode exports
- Early access to new features
CTA: “Go Premium”

7) Surfaced Products (bottom section, commercial)
This is a distinct block with:
- Title: “Surfaced Products”
- Subtitle: “Paid placements from selected providers. These do not affect editorial guidance.”
Render 6 to 12 product cards with:
- Product name
- One-line pitch
- Price range indicator
- Tag chips: “Sponsored”, “New”, “Best for creators”, “Best for comfort”, etc
- A button: “View details”
- A button: “Add to comparison”
Each card must display “Sponsored” when sponsored = true.

Also include a small link-style CTA at the end:
- “Want your product surfaced here?” which links to /smartglasses/partners (placeholder page is fine)

DATA MODEL (mock first, structured for future)
Create a simple backend API layer (or mocked service) for:
A) Trending questions
- GET /api/smartglasses/questions

B) Surfaced products
- GET /api/smartglasses/surfaced-products
Return an array with fields:
  id, name, pitch, priceRange, tags[], sponsored(boolean), imageUrl(optional), detailsUrl(optional)

C) Audit result helper (optional)
- POST /api/smartglasses/audit
Accept audit answers and return:
  profileSummary, considerations[], categoryFits[]

For now you can implement audit logic in the frontend deterministically, but structure it so it could be moved server-side later.

CHAT ENTRY (lightweight)
Add a small embedded chat panel that can be opened after audit results.
- Free users: limit to e.g. 5 messages per day (mock this with local state)
- Premium users: unlimited (mock “premium” with a toggle in dev)

DESIGN AND COPY RULES
- Use UK English spelling.
- Do not use long dashes (avoid “—”).
- Make the sponsored section visually distinct and clearly labelled.
- Keep the page fast and modular.

DELIVERABLES
1) The /smartglasses page implemented with all sections above.
2) Any required components in a clean folder structure.
3) Mock API routes or service files for questions and surfaced products.
4) A placeholder /smartglasses/partners page with a simple vendor interest form (name, company, product, website, email).

TECH NOTES
- If this project uses React + Vite, place the page in client/src/pages/SmartGlasses.tsx and add routing.
- Keep components reusable: AuditWizard, TrendingQuestions, SurfacedProductsGrid, PremiumPanel.
- Do not break existing routes or layout.
- Ensure the page looks good on mobile and desktop.

QUALITY CHECKLIST
- Editorial vs sponsored separation is explicit in UI copy.
- Audit feels useful and produces clear outputs.
- Surfaced Products section is clearly commercial and labelled.
- No long dash characters are used in copy.
- All sections render without backend dependencies.
