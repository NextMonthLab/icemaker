Short answer: yes, it sounds clear and fundamentally correct.
Longer, more useful answer: it’s clear structurally, and with a couple of small refinements it can feel polished and intentional, not just “working”.

I’ll break this into what’s solid and what I’d sanity-check or tighten.

⸻

What you’ve done right (and why it matters)

✅ Professional Editor badge on return

This is excellent.

It does three important jobs instantly:
	•	Explains why the UI looks different
	•	Signals progression, not disruption
	•	Reinforces that the upgrade unlocked capability, not just access

Users need a visible marker that says:

“You’re in a different mode now – on purpose.”

You’ve got that.

⸻

✅ Welcome message on first return

Also correct.

This anchors the emotional moment after payment, which is the most fragile point in the journey.

Without this, users often think:

“Did I break something?”
“Why does this look different?”

So structurally, the flow is sound.

⸻

Where I’d do a final polish pass

These aren’t reworks, just finish-line refinements.

1. Make sure the welcome message does three things (in order)

The welcome message should not be generic. It should explicitly cover these beats, in this sequence:
	1.	Confirmation
	•	“You’re now in the Professional Editor”
	2.	Continuity reassurance
	•	“Everything you created in preview is here”
	3.	Purpose
	•	“This is where you refine, publish, and manage your experience”

If any one of those is missing, the user has to infer too much.

A quick self-check:
	•	If you removed the badge, would the message alone explain the change?
	•	If you removed the message, would the badge alone explain what to do next?

Ideally, either one should carry the meaning on its own.

⸻

2. Avoid feature-listing in the welcome message

This is a common temptation and a mistake.

The welcome moment should not say:
	•	“You can now do X, Y, Z”
	•	“Here are all your new features”

That belongs later.

Right now, the job is orientation, not education.

Think:

“You’ve arrived.”
Not:
“Here’s the manual.”

⸻

3. Ensure this only happens once

This is subtle but important.

The welcome + badge explanation should:
	•	Appear on first post-upgrade return
	•	Never reappear in full again

After that:
	•	The badge can remain
	•	The editor should just be “normal”

If users keep seeing onboarding copy, it cheapens the experience.

⸻

4. Check the emotional tone

The tone should be:
	•	Calm
	•	Confident
	•	Matter-of-fact

Not:
	•	Over-celebratory
	•	Salesy
	•	“Congrats on upgrading!!!”

You’re not rewarding them.
You’re welcoming them into a workspace.

⸻

The one question that tells you if it’s polished

Ask yourself this:

If I paid, came back the next day, and forgot the exact steps I took…
would I immediately understand where I am and why?

If the answer is “yes” without hesitation, you’re there.

From what you’ve described, you’re very close, if not already over the line.

⸻

Net assessment
	•	Clarity: ✅ Yes
	•	Intentionality: ✅ Yes
	•	Trust at the payment moment: ✅ Yes
	•	Polish: 🟡 Likely good, with room for micro-copy tuning

You’ve handled the hardest part correctly:
you didn’t let the UI change feel accidental.

That alone puts you ahead of most SaaS products.

If you want, next I can:
	•	Review or help tighten the exact welcome copy
	•	Help define when and how the badge should fade into “normal”
	•	Or help you decide whether EPIC 3 can now proceed safely (spoiler: it can)

But based on what you’ve said:
this flow is sound.
