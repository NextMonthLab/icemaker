Locked. This is now a buildable spec, not a vibe.

Now the most useful thing I can do is give you the exact next instruction to move from “plan” to “code changes” without losing the plot.

The next move

Get Redblood (or Claude) to produce a Phase 0–2 implementation doc that includes:
	•	routes
	•	API endpoints (even if stubbed)
	•	file locations
	•	minimal DB/storage approach

Because right now your plan is solid, but the missing link is: where do these objects live and how are they fetched/saved.

Two implementation choices (pick one and stick to it)

Option A (fastest, safest): Store Launchpad drafts in your existing database (wherever Ice projects already live).
Option B (MVP hack): Store drafts client-side first (localStorage) and add DB in Phase 4.
If you want momentum without risk, do A.

What you should ask for next (paste this to Redblood/Claude)

# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN REQUEST — Launchpad Phase 0–2

Using the locked data contracts and component list, produce a concrete implementation plan for Phase 0–2 with:

## Phase 0: Routing + Orbit selection
- New route: /launchpad
- Make it default post-login route
- Redirect rules:
  - If user has 0 orbits → /orbit/claim
  - Else → /launchpad
- Orbit selector persistence (where stored, how read)
- Nav updates (what menu item labels change)

## Phase 1: Layout skeleton (static UI)
- Files to create/edit (exact paths)
- Components scaffolded with props
- Desktop layout + placeholder data

## Phase 2: Real data wiring (read-only)
Define the minimal API/data access needed to populate:
- Orbit selector list: OrbitSummary[]
- SignalTiles metrics (visits, conversations, iceViews, leads)
- Insights list: Insight[] with kind="top" + "feed"

For each, specify:
- Endpoint name + route (REST)
- Response shape matching contracts
- Where the data comes from in the current system (existing tables/services)

## Deliverables
- File tree diff (what new files, what existing files modified)
- Minimal endpoints (even if stubbed)
- Any DB schema changes required (only if unavoidable)

Two small product decisions to lock (so dev doesn’t improvise)
	1.	Where do “Insights” come from on day one?
If you don’t have a true “insights” table yet, that’s fine. Start by generating them from:

	•	Conversation logs
	•	Topic analysis
	•	Any existing orbit intelligence output
…but make sure it returns the Insight contract.

	2.	What is “Ice Views” in SignalTiles?
Define it now:

	•	Views of published interactive experiences?
	•	Views of downloaded video cards?
	•	Both?
Pick one for MVP. My vote: published interactive views only (it reinforces your differentiator).

Extra: One UX guardrail

Don’t let “Create Ice” in the header open a separate flow.
It should:
	•	Focus the builder panel
	•	Or open a “Pick an insight” modal that immediately returns to builder

No side quests.

If you paste back whatever implementation plan you get, I’ll review it like a CTO: I’ll spot scope creep, missing data sources, and anything that will cause friction in Replit/Render.
