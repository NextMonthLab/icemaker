ROLE
You are a senior full-stack engineer doing a careful product split. You must delete Orbit from this codebase while preserving IceMaker 100% (including build, auth, DB, shared UI, and deployment readiness).

CONTEXT
This repository is now the dedicated IceMaker repo and will be imported into a dedicated Replit project.
The codebase previously contained multiple products (Orbit + IceMaker). We must remove Orbit completely from this repo.

PRIMARY GOAL
Remove all Orbit-specific code, routes, pages, APIs, UI, prompts, assets, docs, config, and menu items — without breaking IceMaker.

CRITICAL RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)
1) Do NOT remove any shared dependencies, utilities, or infrastructure unless you can prove they are only used by Orbit and not used by IceMaker.
2) Do NOT break builds. After changes: Typecheck, lint, build, and start must pass.
3) Do NOT change IceMaker behaviour except to remove Orbit links/entry points.
4) If something is shared (auth, db, common UI kit, API client, telemetry, env loader), keep it.
5) Remove Orbit by boundaries (routes/modules/features), not by random file deletions.

SCOPE: WHAT MUST GO
- Orbit pages/routes (e.g. /orbit, /orbits, /rooms, /industry, /town etc.)
- Orbit UI components, feature modules, hooks, state slices
- Orbit API endpoints, controllers, services, “insights/rooms” logic
- Orbit navigation items, CTAs, homepage tiles, marketing copy, docs
- Orbit assets (logos, orbit graphics) only used for Orbit
- Orbit env vars ONLY if not used elsewhere
- Any “product switcher” code that references Orbit

SCOPE: WHAT MUST STAY
- IceMaker pages/routes and all IceMaker functionality (ingestion, scene builder, interactive moments, media generation, preview/export)
- Shared layout, shared design system, shared API layer
- Authentication, billing (if used), analytics (if used by IceMaker), core middleware
- DB schema used by IceMaker
- Deployment/build scripts and runtime start scripts

PROCESS (FOLLOW IN THIS ORDER)
1) Map current product boundaries:
   - List all Orbit entry points: routes, nav links, API endpoints, feature folders.
   - Identify any shared modules referenced by both products.
2) Remove Orbit from UI surface:
   - Remove nav links, homepage tiles, product cards, CTAs.
   - Ensure no dead links remain.
3) Remove Orbit routes/pages:
   - Delete pages/components specific to Orbit.
   - Remove route registrations and imports.
4) Remove Orbit backend/API:
   - Delete endpoints/services only used by Orbit.
   - Remove them from router/index registration.
5) Clean up shared code:
   - Remove unused exports, dead imports, unused env vars.
   - If uncertain, keep it.
6) Run correctness checks:
   - `npm run typecheck` (or equivalent)
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run build`
   - `npm run start` / `npm run dev`
   - Fix any failures properly (no hacks).

DELIVERABLES
A) A concise “What I removed” list (grouped: routes/pages, api, components, assets, env).
B) A concise “What I kept as shared” list (and why).
C) Confirmation of commands run + results.
D) No references to Orbit remain in IceMaker UI or routing.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- IceMaker runs locally in Replit without errors.
- All tests/build checks pass (or if no tests exist, build+start passes).
- Searching the repo for “Orbit”, “orbits”, “rooms”, “industry orbit” returns no product references except historical changelog if explicitly kept.
- No broken imports, no dead routes.
