Chef Marco available to answer questions about: yeast activation, kneading technique, proving times, troubleshooting sticky or dry dough. Example Q&A - User: “My dough is really sticky, did I mess up?” Chef: “That’s completely normal! Sticky dough is actually a good sign – it means there’s enough hydration for a lovely, airy crust.

## AI Checkpoint

Chef Marco available to answer questions about: dough thickness, why dough springs back, sauce quantity, whether pepperoni goes under or over cheese. Example Q&A - User: “How thin should the base be?” Chef: “For a nice stone-baked style, aim for about 3-4mm in the centre – thin enough to see light through if you held it up, but not paper thin. The edges should be a bit thicker to give you that lovely puffy crust. Don’t worry if it’s not perfectly round – rustic is beautiful!”

Chef Marco available to answer questions about: oven temperature alternatives, timing adjustments, recognising doneness, troubleshooting uneven cooking. Example Q&A - User: “My oven only goes to 220°C, will it still work?” Chef: “Absolutely! It’ll just take a few minutes longer – maybe 12-15 minutes instead of 8-12. The key is that hot stone or tray. Let it preheat for the full 30 minutes and you’ll still get a lovely crispy base. Keep an eye on it and trust your eyes over the timer!”

Chef Marco available for: celebrating success, storage tips for leftovers, variations to try next time, encouragement to share creation. Example Q&A - User: “Can I freeze leftover dough?” Chef: “Great question! Yes, absolutely. After the first prove, knock it back, wrap tightly in cling film, and freeze for up to 3 months. When you want pizza, move it to the fridge overnight to thaw, then let it come to room temperature for an hour before shaping. You’ve just set yourself up for future pizza nights – well done!”
