Absolutely. This is a clean, decisive refinement, and you’re right to bundle both changes together. They reinforce each other.

Below is a revised, authoritative prompt you can give Repl.it that:
	1.	Updates the sliding scenario case studies with human imagery
	2.	Makes the component reusable across sub-pages
	3.	Adds Businesses / Creators / Educators as first-class destinations in the global menu
	4.	Keeps everything aligned with your canonical behaviours and homepage strategy

You can paste this verbatim.

Revised Prompt to Repl.it: Scenario Case Studies + Audience Pages

Homepage & Navigation Update – Scenario Proof + Audience Clarity

We are refining the homepage and global navigation to make it immediately clear who NextMonth is for and how ICE experiences are used in the real world.

This update has two parts:
	1.	A revised sliding scenario case study component with imagery
	2.	Clear audience sub-pages added to the global menu

⸻

Part 1: Sliding Scenario Case Studies (With Images)

Implement a prominent sliding scenario / case study component on the homepage (below the hero and value framing).

These are illustrative scenarios, not real testimonials.

Component Requirements
	•	Horizontal slider / carousel
	•	One scenario per slide
	•	Each slide includes:
	•	A strong, situational image
	•	A short title (who this is for)
	•	A concise description covering:
	•	What they already have
	•	What they do with ICE
	•	The outcome

Avoid metrics, logos, or exaggerated claims.

⸻

Scenario Images (Important)

Each scenario must include a human, real-world image to help visitors visually self-identify.

Image guidelines:
	•	Editorial, grounded, and realistic
	•	Human environments (workshop, desk, classroom, creative space)
	•	No product UI screenshots
	•	No abstract or futuristic AI art
	•	Avoid obvious corporate stock

Images should feel cohesive as a set (similar tone, grading, framing).

⸻

Initial Scenarios to Include
	1.	Innovative Business / Manufacturer
Turning technical documents into an interactive experience, with an AI engineer answering questions about new technology.
	2.	Established Business with Legacy Content
Converting years of high-quality blog posts into cinematic, video-first content for LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels.
	3.	Teacher / Educator
Turning fact sheets into engaging, character-driven interactive lessons (including historical figures explaining science concepts).
	4.	Independent Filmmaker
Using ICE as a living storyboard to align a creative team with generated scenes before production.
	5.	Amateur Writer / Creator
Bringing unpublished short stories to life and sharing them publicly via video platforms.

⸻

Reusability

This scenario component should be reusable on audience-specific sub-pages, showing only the most relevant scenarios for that audience.

⸻

Part 2: Audience Sub-Pages & Global Menu Update

Add clear audience-focused sub-pages and include them in the global navigation menu:
	•	Businesses
	•	Creators
	•	Educators

Purpose
	•	Allow visitors to self-select immediately
	•	Reduce cognitive load on the homepage
	•	Let people go directly to the context that resonates most with them

Each sub-page should:
	•	Reuse the scenario component (filtered appropriately)
	•	Reinforce time-saving and outcome-driven value
	•	Speak in the language of that audience (not generic product features)

⸻

Tone & Intent
	•	Show real-world applicability, not abstract capability
	•	Emphasise time compression, clarity, and creative leverage
	•	Make NextMonth feel immediately relevant to different types of users

This is a core positioning update, not decorative content.

Please implement and confirm once the homepage section and global menu updates are in place.

⸻

Why this is the right move (quick reassurance)
	•	The homepage now:
	•	Explains value
	•	Shows believable use
	•	Lets people self-identify fast
	•	The global menu now:
	•	Reduces friction
	•	Prevents “is this for me?” doubt
	•	Gives visitors a clear next click

This is how strong platforms move from “interesting” to “obvious”.

Once Repl.it comes back with a first pass, the next step will simply be:
	•	tightening copy,
	•	ordering scenarios,
	•	and checking visual consistency.

You’ve framed this extremely well.
