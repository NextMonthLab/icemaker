Absolutely. Here’s a clear, authoritative instruction you can send to Replit that locks Option A and explains why, so it doesn’t get second-guessed later.

You can paste this verbatim.

Instruction to Replit: Flow Correction – Launch Interactive Builder

Flow Decision Confirmed – Option A (Canonical)

We are confirming Option A for the “Launch Interactive Builder” flow.

Decision
	•	Launch Interactive Builder → /try
	•	This route must start the guest preview builder immediately, with no login required.

Rationale (important)
	•	Our product follows a guest-first, preview-led conversion model.
	•	Users must be able to create and experience value within seconds before identity or payment is requested.
	•	Routing to /login at this point introduces unnecessary friction and contradicts the canonical upsell journey.

Correct Use of /login

/login should only be shown when the user explicitly chooses to:
	•	Save progress
	•	Upgrade
	•	Review publishing options
	•	Enter the Professional Editor / Dashboard

At those points, login serves identity and continuity, not gatekeeping.

Why Option A Is Required
	•	Aligns with documented canonical behaviours:
	•	Guest preview creation
	•	Experience before identity
	•	Conversion through interaction
	•	Prevents misleading CTAs (no “start creating” → login mismatch)
	•	Preserves flow integrity and reduces drop-off

This decision is now canonical and should be treated as final.
Do not re-route “Launch Interactive Builder” to /login or equivalent entry points.

If a CTA routes to /login, it must be explicitly labelled as Sign in, Dashboard, or Account access.

Why this wording works
	•	It states the decision unambiguously
	•	It ties the choice back to your canonical behaviours
	•	It explains the product logic, not just preference
	•	It prevents future “helpful” rewrites that break the flow

If you want, next we can:
	•	Audit every CTA → route → intent in the app
	•	Or write a short routing rules section for replit.md so this never regresses

But yes — Option A is the right call, and this locks it in cleanly.
