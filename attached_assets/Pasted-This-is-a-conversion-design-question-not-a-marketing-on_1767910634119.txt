This is a conversion design question, not a marketing one — and if you get it right, it’ll feel obvious rather than salesy.

The core principle is this:

Industry Orbits orient you.
Business Orbits operationalise you.

So the goal is not to “sell” a Business Orbit.
It’s to make it feel like the natural next step once someone realises, “this matters to me specifically.”

Below is the clean, universal way to do that.

⸻

First: where not to do it (important)

Do not:
	•	Add a big CTA banner
	•	Add popups on arrival
	•	Add “Create your own Orbit” buttons everywhere
	•	Interrupt first-time exploration

That turns a neutral Industry Orbit into a funnel — and that breaks trust.

⸻

The right mental shift for the user

When a business user is in the Smart Glasses Industry Orbit, they should gradually think:
	•	“This is useful”
	•	“This is neutral”
	•	“This is helping me understand the space”
	•	…then…
	•	“But my situation is more specific than this.”

That last thought is your opening.

Your job is to recognise that moment and respond, not force it.

⸻

The universal mechanism: Contextual Reflection

The pattern

You surface the idea of a Business Orbit only when the user expresses specificity.

That means:
	•	They ask a company-specific question
	•	They ask about their customers
	•	They ask about positioning
	•	They ask about decisions (“should we…”)

At that moment, the Industry Orbit gently reflects back:

“That’s a business-specific question.”

And then offers a next step.

⸻

How this looks in practice (clean and subtle)

1. Inside responses (primary method)

When the user asks something like:
	•	“Are smart glasses worth it for our retail stores?”
	•	“Should we be investing in smart glasses in 2026?”
	•	“How would smart glasses affect our compliance?”

The response ends with a quiet divider, not a CTA:

This Orbit gives a neutral industry view.
If you want answers tailored to your business, you can spin up a private Orbit that builds on this intelligence.

Then:
	•	a single button: “Create a Business Orbit”
	•	secondary text: Takes under a minute

No pricing. No hype. No urgency.

This works because it feels like capability, not upsell.

⸻

2. A persistent but non-invasive affordance (secondary)

In the Industry Orbit UI (same for all Industry Orbits):

A small, consistent element, e.g. top-right or side rail:

“Apply this to your business →”

That’s it.

Not:
	•	“Start free”
	•	“Create now”
	•	“Upgrade”

Just:

Apply this to your business

Clicking it explains:
	•	Industry Orbit = neutral, shared
	•	Business Orbit = private, opinionated, decision-focused

This reinforces the distinction you’ve worked so hard to protect.

⸻

3. The “mirror moment” (high leverage)

After a user has:
	•	Clicked several tiles
	•	Read multiple responses
	•	Spent time in the Orbit

You can surface a one-time inline reflection:

“You’ve been exploring how smart glasses are changing the industry.
Many teams create a private Orbit to explore what this means for them.”

Then:
	•	“Create a Business Orbit” (primary)
	•	“Keep exploring” (secondary)

Important:
This appears once, ever, per user per Industry Orbit.

That makes it feel respectful.

⸻

How Business Orbits should be framed (this matters)

Never frame it as:
	•	“your own chatbot”
	•	“your own AI”
	•	“custom answers”

Frame it as:

“A private Orbit that builds on industry intelligence, but learns from your context.”

Key differences you should clearly state:
	•	Industry Orbit: neutral, shared, observational
	•	Business Orbit: private, decision-oriented, opinionated by design

That makes the upgrade feel necessary, not optional.

⸻

One very important rule

Never suggest that the Industry Orbit is “insufficient.”

It is sufficient — for orientation.

The Business Orbit exists because:
	•	businesses have constraints
	•	businesses have goals
	•	businesses have risk

That’s not a flaw in the Industry Orbit. It’s reality.

⸻

The one-sentence positioning you should bake into the system

You’ll probably want this somewhere canonical:

“Industry Orbits help you understand what’s happening. Business Orbits help you decide what to do about it.”

If Replit, Claude, designers, and copy all align on that sentence, everything stays clean.

⸻

Why this will work (and scale)
	•	It respects neutrality
	•	It avoids aggressive conversion
	•	It triggers only when relevance is proven
	•	It works identically across all Industry Orbits
	•	It reinforces your core distinction instead of blurring it

And crucially:

People won’t feel sold to.
They’ll feel invited.

If you want, next we can:
	•	write the exact copy blocks for those moments
	•	define the trigger logic precisely
	•	or design the first-run experience of a Business Orbit that makes the value obvious in under 30 seconds
