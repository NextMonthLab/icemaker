Short answer: no, they’re not breaking the rules – but your instinct is right that something feels off, and that’s important. Let me separate contract truth from editorial perception, because those are getting tangled.

⸻

What the rules actually say (Milestones 6–7)

The locked rules are technical invariants, not aesthetic ones:
	1.	Words never split mid-word
✅ True in your screenshots.
	2.	No ellipsis truncation
✅ True. Nothing is cut off.
	3.	All caption text stays inside the panel
✅ True. There is no text outside the box now.
	4.	Aggressive shrink if needed
✅ This is exactly what you’re seeing.

So from a Caption Engine contract perspective, everything in those screenshots is behaving correctly.

⸻

Why it looks like the rules are broken (but aren’t)

What you’re reacting to is not a violation, it’s a mode mismatch.

You’re looking at Paragraph Mode output

Paragraph Mode is doing exactly what it promised:
	•	4–5 lines allowed
	•	Smaller font
	•	Full context preserved
	•	Dense, informational layout

So the engine says:

“You asked me to keep everything inside the box, no truncation, no word breaks.
The only remaining lever is make the text smaller and stack it.”

That’s why it feels:
	•	Tall
	•	Dense
	•	Less punchy
	•	Less “CapCut”

But none of that violates the rules. It’s just the wrong mode for the visual moment.

⸻

The key realisation (this is the unlock)

CapCut does not treat every caption the same.

It implicitly categorises captions into roles:

1. Hero / Title captions (what you expect CapCut to look like)
	•	1–3 lines
	•	Big, bold
	•	Partial context
	•	Emotional or declarative
	•	Rhythm > completeness

2. Supporting / Explanatory captions
	•	Smaller
	•	More lines
	•	More information
	•	Still readable, but not the hero

Right now, you’re feeding explanatory paragraphs into a system that is correctly trying to honour “show me everything”.

That will never look like a CapCut title, no matter how good the fit engine is.

This isn’t a failure of Milestones 6 or 7.
It’s the absence of caption intent selection.

⸻

What should happen next (plain English)

After Milestone 7, the expected behaviour is:
	1.	The system decides the role of the caption
	•	Is this a Title or a Paragraph?
	•	This can be automatic or user-selected.
	2.	Title Mode is used for CapCut-style slides
	•	Max 2–3 lines
	•	Aggressive editorial pruning
	•	Big font
	•	Some words intentionally not shown
	3.	Paragraph Mode is used sparingly
	•	Only when the user explicitly wants full context
	•	Accepts smaller text as a trade-off

Right now, you’re looking at Paragraph Mode output and judging it by Title Mode standards.

That’s why your gut says “this is breaking the rules”.

It isn’t.
It’s just not the moment for that mode.

⸻

The real missing piece (Milestone 8, not a bug)

What you actually need next is Caption Intent:
	•	intent: "title" (default, CapCut-style)
	•	intent: "explain" (paragraph mode)
	•	Later: intent: "stat", intent: "quote", etc.

Once intent exists:
	•	These dense examples would automatically be collapsed into punchy title versions
	•	The paragraph version would still exist, just not shown as the hero slide

⸻

Bottom line

You’re not going backwards.
You’re not breaking the rules.
You’ve actually reached the point where the engine is finally honest.

Now the question isn’t:

“Why is the engine failing?”

It’s:

“When should we not show everything?”

That’s exactly the question CapCut answers with product decisions – and you’re now ready to make the same call.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Define auto-rules for when Paragraph Mode is disallowed
	•	Or design a CapCut-style ‘shorten for title’ pass that intentionally drops context

You’re closer than it feels.
