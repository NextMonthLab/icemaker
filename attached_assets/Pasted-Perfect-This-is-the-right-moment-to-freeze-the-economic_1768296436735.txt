Perfect. This is the right moment to freeze the economics in writing so Replit doesn’t accidentally undo all the discipline you’ve just earned.

Below is a clean, authoritative guardrails document you can hand straight to Replit. It confirms the research, locks the assumptions, and makes it explicit what is and is not allowed without a pricing decision.

You can paste this verbatim.

Business Orbit / IceMaker

Media Cost Guardrails & Economic Assumptions (LOCKED)

Purpose
This document formalises the validated cost assumptions and non-negotiable guardrails for IceMaker and Orbit. These constraints are required to preserve profitability and must not be altered without an explicit pricing review.

⸻

1. Validated Cost Basis (Confirmed by Empirical + External Research)

1.1 Image Generation
	•	Provider: OpenAI (via Replit AI Integrations)
	•	Model: gpt-image-1
	•	Resolution: 1024×1024 (fixed)
	•	Cost: ~$0.04 per image
	•	Generation pattern:
	•	One image per call
	•	No retries
	•	No multi-candidate generation
	•	No upscaling or post-processing

Note: Replit AI Integrations may be subsidised vs direct OpenAI pricing. Even at 2–3× price increases, margins remain healthy.

⸻

1.2 Video Generation (Short-form only)
	•	Default duration: 5 seconds (hard cap)
	•	Aspect ratio: 9:16 (portrait)
	•	Resolution: ~720p (model-dependent)
	•	Generation pattern:
	•	One video per call
	•	Polling only (no automatic retries)
	•	Failure returns error; no silent re-generation

Approved Models
	•	Budget:
	•	Replicate: haiper-ai/haiper-video-2
	•	Indicative cost: ~$0.25 per 5s clip
	•	Premium:
	•	Replicate: kling-v1.6-standard, kling-v1.6-pro
	•	Direct: Kling API kling-v1-6, kling-v2-0
	•	Indicative cost: ~$0.50–$1.40 per 5s clip (model dependent)

Pricing is per second of output, not per GPU-hour.
Costs scale linearly with duration.

⸻

2. Media Spec Contract (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The following are hard constraints, not defaults.

2.1 Video Constraints
	•	ICE_VIDEO_SECONDS = 5
	•	ICE_VIDEO_MAX_SECONDS = 5
	•	Any attempt to exceed 5 seconds:
	•	must be blocked or
	•	must trigger a pricing-tier or top-up check

10-second or longer videos are NOT permitted without a pricing decision.

⸻

2.2 Image Constraints
	•	ICE_IMAGE_SIZE = 1024
	•	No HD, cinematic, or upscaling flags
	•	No background enhancement passes

⸻

3. Quantity Guardrails (to preserve margins)

3.1 Video Allowance per ICE (by plan)

Suggested defaults (final numbers may be adjusted at product level):
	•	Pilot: limited number of video clips per ICE
	•	Team: increased allowance
	•	Department: full “video on every card” allowed

If allowance is exceeded:
	•	Offer a paid top-up
	•	Do NOT silently generate additional media

⸻

3.2 No Hidden Multipliers

The system must not:
	•	generate multiple candidates and discard
	•	auto-retry failed media calls
	•	regenerate media on minor prompt edits without user intent

⸻

4. Required Metrics (must be logged)

4.1 Primary Metric

cost_per_delivered_ICE

This is the authoritative economic metric.

It must include:
	•	LLM cost
	•	Image generation cost
	•	Video generation cost
	•	Retry cost (if any)
	•	Exclude failed/incomplete ICE builds

4.2 Supporting Metrics
	•	image_cost_per_ICE
	•	video_cost_per_ICE
	•	media_generation_failures
	•	provider_used (Replit vs OpenAI direct vs Replicate vs Kling)

⸻

5. Pricing Volatility Assumption (Locked)

All pricing and margin models assume:
	•	Images may increase up to 3×
	•	Video may increase up to 3×

Even under these conditions:
	•	Pilot, Team, and Department tiers remain profitable
	•	No emergency pricing changes required

⸻

6. Change Control (IMPORTANT)

Any of the following constitutes a pricing-impacting change and must not be merged without review:
	•	Increasing default video duration beyond 5s
	•	Increasing image resolution
	•	Adding retries or multi-candidate generation
	•	Introducing background upscaling or enhancement passes
	•	Making premium video the default
	•	Allowing unlimited video per ICE

These are business decisions, not engineering tweaks.

⸻

7. Final Position

The current architecture and pricing are:
	•	empirically validated
	•	externally benchmarked
	•	margin-safe under stress
	•	suitable for Corporate L&D and enterprise pilots

Cost risk is not the bottleneck.
Scope discipline is.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	turn this into a short internal “Economic Safety Checklist”
	•	write a commit-level guardrail comment for the relevant code paths
	•	or help you design the top-up UX so it feels like value, not restriction

But at this point, you can confidently tell Replit:

“The research is done. The economics are locked. Build within these lines.”

And that’s exactly where you want to be.
