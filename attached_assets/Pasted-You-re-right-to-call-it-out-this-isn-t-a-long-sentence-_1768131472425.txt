You’re right to call it out: this isn’t a “long sentence” problem. It’s a layout contract problem.

Right now the engine is doing this:
	•	Keeping the panel width relatively narrow (maxWidth)
	•	Keeping the font size relatively large
	•	Clamping to 2–3 lines
	•	Centring everything

So even a short phrase can end up with ugly breaks if the available line width is too small for the chosen font size.

We fix it by giving the caption system a clear hierarchy of constraints, instead of letting the browser improvise.

The correct hierarchy (CapCut-style)
	1.	Never break inside words (unless it’s a monster word)
	2.	Prefer 2 lines for headline
	3.	If it doesn’t fit, widen the panel a bit
	4.	If it still doesn’t fit, reduce font size slightly
	5.	Only then allow 3 lines
	6.	Last resort: clamp (ellipsis), but not for normal headlines

That’s the behaviour you want.

What we’re going to do (concrete)

1) Make the panel wider for headlines

Your panel maxWidth is probably ~82–92%. For big text, that can still be too tight because padding + border radius eats width.

Set headline panel to something like:
	•	maxWidth: '94%' (or even 96%)
	•	and reduce padding slightly when text is short

Example logic in resolveStyles():
	•	short headline (<= 20 chars): comfy padding
	•	medium (21–45): normal padding
	•	long (>45): slightly reduced padding + slightly smaller font

2) Introduce “fit to box” font scaling (simple heuristic)

Instead of scaling based on total string length (which is crude), scale based on:
	•	word count
	•	longest word length
	•	target lines

Because “generative” is 10 chars and should never break, you treat it differently than a string with lots of short words.

Heuristic that works well:
	•	If longest word > 12, scale down a notch
	•	If wordCount <= 4, prefer larger font and wider panel
	•	If wordCount <= 6, cap at 2 lines and adjust font
	•	If > 6, allow 3 lines

3) Ensure wrapping rules are sane

For headlines:
	•	hyphens: none
	•	wordBreak: normal
	•	overflowWrap: break-word (not anywhere)

This guarantees “generative” stays intact unless it literally cannot fit.

⸻

The actual change you should implement (drop-in plan)

A) Add these measurements

In resolveStyles():
	•	const words = headline.trim().split(/\s+/)
	•	const wordCount = words.length
	•	const longestWord = Math.max(...words.map(w => w.length))

B) Decide line clamp + scale
	•	Default: 2 lines
	•	If wordCount > 6, allow 3 lines
	•	If longestWord >= 12, reduce fontScale 0.9
	•	If longestWord >= 16, reduce fontScale 0.82

C) Widen panel when you need room
	•	If wordCount <= 6, set panel maxWidth: '96%'
	•	Otherwise maxWidth: '92%'

This alone will stop “generati / ve”.

Why this works

Because the browser is currently being forced into a corner: it’s trying to satisfy a narrow container, big font, and clamp. So it breaks words.

We stop the word breaking by giving it more room first (panel width), and only then adjusting font size and line count.

⸻

The punchline

Short phrases should look heroic. If “As generative AI too…” can’t fit, then the system is currently optimised for the wrong constraint.

So we’ll:
	•	widen the box
	•	scale intelligently
	•	clamp by lines
	•	never split ordinary words

If you want, paste the current panelStyle values your resolver outputs (maxWidth + padding) and the headline font size it’s choosing on these examples, and I’ll give you the exact thresholds to use so it looks right across iPhone sizes.
