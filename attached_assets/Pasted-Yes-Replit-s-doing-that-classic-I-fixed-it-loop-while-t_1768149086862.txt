Yes. Replit’s doing that classic “I fixed it” loop while the same bug keeps showing up. Time to stop guessing and inspect the code directly like an adult.

Here’s how to do it fast, without turning it into a week-long archaeology dig.

The root cause (based on your screenshots)

That “ing 58%…” clip is not a font sizing issue anymore. It’s a layout boundary issue:
	•	The caption bubble is sometimes rendering wider than the visible frame OR
	•	It’s being centred inside a narrower parent, then clipped by an overflow: hidden ancestor.

So we need to find:
	1.	Which element defines the visible frame bounds
	2.	Which element is being measured
	3.	Which element is clipping
	4.	Whether the caption is being positioned relative to the wrong parent

No more “maxWidth: 100%” duct tape. We need the real geometry.

What to inspect first (90 seconds)

Search the repo for these in order:

1) overflow: hidden

This is usually the real villain. Find the closest overflow-hidden ancestor above the caption.

Search:
	•	overflow: 'hidden'
	•	overflow-hidden
	•	className.*overflow

When you find it, note:
	•	what element it’s on (frame wrapper? page wrapper? player container?)
	•	its width rules (fixed px? %? max-width?)

2) Where container width is measured

Search:
	•	setContainerWidthPx(
	•	offsetWidth
	•	clientWidth
	•	getBoundingClientRect
	•	ResizeObserver

Then check:
	•	which ref is being measured
	•	is it the actual video frame or some outer wrapper?

3) Caption positioning

Search:
	•	ScaleToFitCaption
	•	position: 'absolute'
	•	left: '50%'
	•	transform: 'translateX(-50%)'
	•	margin: '0 auto'

If it’s absolute, it must be absolute relative to the frame, not the page.

⸻

The surgical fix (what it usually ends up being)

✅ Make the caption layer fill the frame, and centre inside that

The caption wrapper should be:

position: "absolute",
left: 0,
right: 0,
bottom: somePx,
display: "flex",
justifyContent: "center",
pointerEvents: "none",

Then the bubble can just be width: panelWidthPx and it will never drift.

If you centre with left: 50% + translate, you’re more likely to get clipping when widths wobble.

✅ Measure the frame, not a parent

The measurement ref must be attached to the element that actually corresponds to the preview’s 9:16 visible area.

The gold standard here is:
	•	use getBoundingClientRect().width on the frame element
	•	and feed that into the fit engine

If you measure a padded wrapper then render inside an inner clipped wrapper, you get exactly what you’re seeing.

⸻

What I’d do right now (direct, no fluff)
	1.	Open DevTools on the preview
	2.	Inspect the clipped caption text node
	3.	In the Elements panel, move up the DOM until you find:
	•	the element that is clipping (look for overflow hidden)
	4.	Copy the className/component name
	5.	Go to the codebase and fix it at the source

You’ll find it in minutes.

If you want me to be properly useful here

Paste just these 3 snippets (no whole repo needed):
	1.	The JSX + styles for ScaleToFitCaption (bubble + wrapper)
	2.	The JSX for the preview “frame” component (whatever renders the 9:16 area)
	3.	The code where containerWidthPx is computed (the ref + measurement logic)

With that, I can tell you exactly:
	•	what element you should measure,
	•	what element you should position against,
	•	and what single style rule is causing the clip.

And yeah: at this point, inspecting code directly is the right move. Replit’s in “confidence theatre” mode.
