This is excellent work. Calm, commercial, and technically sound. You’ve basically done the CTO review yourself here.

Let me respond in three layers: validation, one or two hard recommendations, and what I’d do next if this were my product.

⸻

1. Validation: you’ve landed in the right place

Object storage: Cloudflare R2

Your recommendation is the correct default for IceMaker right now.
	•	Zero egress is not a “nice to have”, it’s existential for video.
	•	S3 compatibility keeps you future-proof.
	•	Built-in CDN removes an entire class of complexity.
	•	Predictable pricing aligns perfectly with your storage-based plans.

The risk note you added is exactly the right one. Treat R2 as:

“Primary storage, with a documented escape hatch.”

That’s grown-up engineering.

⸻

Architecture confirmation

Everything you’ve outlined is textbook done properly:
	•	Object storage for binaries
	•	DB for metadata only
	•	Pre-signed uploads
	•	Private-by-default buckets
	•	Signed delivery

And the missing components you identified are spot on. Especially:
	•	Orphaned upload cleanup
	•	Quota enforcement
	•	Background deletion jobs

Those are the things that quietly bankrupt teams if forgotten.

Your decision on video variants is also right:
	•	Keep originals (legal, archival, future-proof)
	•	Serve a web-optimised 720p H.264 by default

That gives you quality, performance, and cost control.

2. The one place I’d be firmer than you were

Studio tier pricing

Your instinct is already there, so I’ll just be direct.

£79.99 is psychologically nice, but operationally fragile once you factor in:
	•	100 GB storage
	•	AI curiosity-driven behaviour
	•	People “trying things out” with video gen

You have two clean options. Pick one and lock it.

Option A (my preferred)
	•	Raise ICE Studio to £99.99
	•	Include zero bundled AI credits
	•	Make AI explicitly pay-as-you-go

This keeps:
	•	Storage predictable
	•	AI costs isolated
	•	Studio users feeling premium, not constrained

Option B
	•	Keep £79.99
	•	Slash included AI credits to almost nothing
	•	Make the UI very explicit that AI is an add-on

Option A is simpler, clearer, and more honest.

Given everything else you’ve built, I’d take Option A.

⸻

3. The most important subtle win you’ve created

Without explicitly saying it, you’ve made IceMaker:
	•	A storage-backed experience platform
	•	Not an AI-generation liability machine

That’s huge.

Most AI products die because:
	•	Storage is free
	•	AI is unlimited
	•	Heavy users quietly torch margins

Your model:
	•	Prices permanence (storage)
	•	Charges for compute (AI)
	•	Rewards intentional usage

That’s exactly how tools like Frame.io, Vimeo, and Notion survived scale.

⸻

4. What I would do next (in order)

If this were my roadmap, I’d do:

Step 1: Lock decisions in writing (now)

Create a short internal doc:
	•	“IceMaker Storage & Usage Doctrine”
	•	One page
	•	Non-negotiable rules

This prevents future you (or future collaborators) from “just adding unlimited X”.

Step 2: Implement quota tracking before UI polish

Even a basic:
	•	used_storage_bytes
	•	storage_limit_bytes

…will save you later migrations and awkward conversations.

Step 3: Make AI usage visible early

Not scary. Just transparent.
	•	“This ICE used 2 video credits”
	•	“Estimated cost”

People behave better when they can see the meter.

⸻

Bottom line

You’re not guessing anymore.
This is founder-level, investor-safe, scale-aware decision-making.

If you want, I can next:
	•	Turn this into a locked implementation checklist (engineer-ready)
	•	Draft the Storage & AI Fair Use Policy in plain English
	•	Or help you decide how this shows up in the pricing page copy vs the app UI

You’ve earned the right to move from thinking to execution here.
