Nice work — that audit is exactly the kind of “we don’t accidentally build a charity” discipline you need.

Based on what’s in the doc (build costs from ~$0.30 for a short ICE up to $10–$12 for a full cinematic ICE, and runtime at roughly **$0.01 per Q&A question / ~$0.05 per viewer session**) plus the risk flags (unbounded chat context + no quotas + no rate limits), here’s where we should land.

1) What pricing has to protect you from

Your real profit killers are not “narration vs music vs images”.

They’re:
	1.	Unbounded chat context → token usage explodes as history grows.
	2.	No per-tenant quotas / credits → one power user can bankrupt a plan.
	3.	No Q&A rate limits → someone can hammer the endpoint all day.
	4.	Video generation defaults → your own config gives away expensive output.

So the pricing model must be paired with hard guardrails. Without them, no pricing page in the world saves you.

2) Don’t itemise features — meter the two cost buckets

You were right to avoid a shopping list of “TTS: £x, music: £y…”.

Instead, you need two allowances:
	•	Build allowance (covers ingestion + structuring + narration + music + images + optional video)
	•	Audience allowance (covers viewer Q&A)

That keeps the pricing page clean, and it matches how your costs actually behave.

3) Short / Medium / Long is a good UX preset — not a hard cage

Use Short / Medium / Long as:
	•	a creator preset in the UI (6 / 10 / 15 cards as defaults)
	•	a pricing explainer (“this plan typically covers X short ICEs/month”)

…but don’t hard-limit customers to “exactly 10 cards”. Credit/budget enforcement is more flexible and less annoying.

4) MVP pricing I’d ship (profit-safe)

This assumes: video is not “included by default” on lower tiers. Video is either a Pro add-on pack or credit top-up.

Starter — £29/mo

For solo creators and small pilots.
	•	Build allowance: enough for ~2 Short or 1 Medium ICE/month
	•	Audience allowance: ~500 questions/month
	•	Video generation: off (or 1 clip/month max)
	•	Storage cap (small)

Pro — £59/mo (your main plan)

For real use.
	•	Build allowance: ~4 Medium or 1 Long ICE/month
	•	Audience allowance: ~1,500 questions/month
	•	Video add-on pack: optional (so you never get killed by cinematic users)

Team — £149/mo (includes 3 seats) + £25/extra seat

For L&D + agencies.
	•	Build allowance: ~10 Medium or 3 Long ICE/month
	•	Audience allowance: ~5,000 questions/month
	•	Includes collaboration/roles
	•	Video pack included or discounted (team buyers actually use it)

Enterprise — custom
	•	High Q&A volumes, SSO, security, SLAs

Top-ups (critical for margin)
	•	Audience pack: +1,000 questions
	•	Build pack: enough for another 2–4 ICEs depending on size
	•	Video pack: priced separately (because it’s the spikiest cost)

This setup ensures your worst-case heavy usage becomes upsell revenue, not a margin hole.

5) Guardrails you should implement before launch

These come straight from your audit risks:

Chat/Q&A
	•	Hard cap: max 20 messages of context retained
	•	Hard cap: max 25 questions per session
	•	Per-user rate limit (e.g. 10 Q/min, burst-safe)
	•	Per-tenant monthly allowance enforced (questions counter)

Pipeline
	•	Input truncation rules (you already cap some chars; formalise it)
	•	Default model tiering: move cheap steps to gpt-4o-mini where acceptable (the doc calls out 70–80% savings)

Caching
	•	Cache TTS by content hash (don’t regenerate narration for the same card)
	•	Cache images by prompt hash where appropriate (or at least allow “reuse”)

Video
	•	Remove any “free bundled videos by default” behaviour on Starter/Pro
	•	Make video an explicit toggle + “this will use X allowance” message

If you do nothing else: cap chat context + rate limit Q&A + enforce quotas. That’s your non-negotiable triple lock.

6) What I want from RatBlood next (so we can finalise numbers)

Your doc includes estimated vendor prices for GPT-5.1, images, etc. That’s fine for modelling, but we now need empirical measurements (your section C already outlines it).

Have RatBlood run:
	•	Short: 6 cards + 3 images
	•	Medium: 10 cards + narration
	•	Long: 15 cards + 4 videos

…and return:
	•	average tokens per build stage
	•	average tokens per Q&A question with the real chat route
	•	real asset sizes produced (storage impact)

Once you paste those measured outputs, I’ll convert the above into:
	•	a clean pricing table for the site
	•	exact monthly allowances
	•	top-up pricing that locks in a target gross margin (e.g. 70%+)

If you want the fastest path: tell me which you prefer as the “default buyer” for MVP:
	•	Corporate L&D (demo-led, fewer but higher value accounts), or
	•	Self-serve creators/marketers (higher volume, tighter cost control needed)

I’ll bias the allowances and plan naming accordingly.
