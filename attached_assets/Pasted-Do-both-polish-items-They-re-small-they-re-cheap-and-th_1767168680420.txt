Do both polish items. They’re small, they’re cheap, and they’ll save you pain later.

Priority order
	1.	Add the “why paused” messaging (fastest UX win, reduces confusion immediately)
	2.	Add the append-only billing audit log (future-you will thank you when Stripe or a customer disputes anything)

You’ve already done the hard engineering. These are the seatbelts.

⸻

1) “Why paused” messaging

What to do

Keep the 410 (good choice), but add a clear, user-facing explanation without leaking billing details.

For public visitors (no auth), something like:
	•	message: "This experience is temporarily unavailable."
	•	reason: "paused_subscription" (optional internal code)
	•	cta: "If you own this experience, sign in to reactivate."

For the owner (authed), include the direct explanation:
	•	message: "Paused due to subscription status. Reactivate your plan to restore this experience."

This avoids:
	•	“Is it broken?”
	•	“Did they delete it?”
	•	Support tickets

⸻

2) Append-only billing audit log

Yes, add it.

Make it append-only and boring. You don’t need a whole analytics system, just a reliable trail.

Minimum schema (recommended)
	•	id (uuid or serial)
	•	created_at (timestamp)
	•	user_id
	•	event_type (enum/string)
	•	stripe_event_id (nullable, but nice)
	•	checkout_session_id / payment_intent_id / subscription_id (nullable)
	•	price_id
	•	currency
	•	expected_amount
	•	stripe_amount
	•	status_before
	•	status_after
	•	metadata (jsonb for anything extra)

What events to log (keep it tight)
	•	checkout_session_created
	•	payment_verified (or checkout_completed)
	•	payment_rejected_amount_mismatch
	•	subscription_status_changed (normalised internal status)
	•	ice_paused_due_to_subscription
	•	subscription_reactivated
	•	ice_restored

That’s enough to reconstruct any incident.

One rule

Log after you have authoritative info (e.g., after webhook verification), so the log is trustworthy.

Move on to product work after these two

Once those are in, you can confidently shift back to product knowing:
	•	Users won’t be confused by paused experiences
	•	You have an audit trail for anything billing-related

If Replit is in execution mode, give it this as the next instruction:

Implement two billing polish items:
	1.	Add clear “paused due to subscription status” messaging (public-safe + owner-specific) while keeping 410 behaviour.
	2.	Add an append-only billing_audit_log table and write audit entries on key billing events (checkout created, verified, rejected mismatch, subscription status changes, pause/restore actions).
No refactors. No changes to existing revenue protection logic. Ship minimal, reliable implementation.

When that’s done: we go straight back to product.
