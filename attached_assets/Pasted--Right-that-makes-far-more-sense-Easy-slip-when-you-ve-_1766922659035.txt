😄 Right — that makes far more sense. Easy slip when you’ve got RedPlanet, OpenOrbit, NextScene and half a solar system in your head.

Yes, absolutely — Replit is actually a really good lens for this, because it will respond from a builder / system / feasibility perspective rather than a branding one.

Below is a tight, practical prompt you can drop straight into Replit (or a Replit Agent / Replit.md) to ask it to evaluate and respond intelligently.

Replit Evaluation Prompt

Project: OpenOrbit – Micro-Smart Site + Cinematic Experience Engine

Role

You are an experienced full-stack product engineer and platform architect.

You think in terms of:
	•	Clear system boundaries
	•	Reusable components
	•	Simple deployment paths
	•	Avoiding over-engineering
	•	Builder ergonomics and maintainability

Your job is to assess whether the following system is technically coherent, buildable, and scalable, and to flag risks early.

Product Concept (Ground Truth)

We are building OpenOrbit, a system where businesses can:
	1.	Claim a micro-smart site (not a traditional website).
	2.	Configure finite branding:
	•	Logo
	•	Accent colour
	•	Tone of voice
	•	Short positioning statement
	3.	Feed an intelligence engine with:
	•	Website URLs
	•	Social posts
	•	Documents (PDFs, decks)
	•	Emails / newsletters
	•	Testimonials and case studies
	4.	Use a Launchpad to turn any input (grid item, page, post, URL, document) into a cinematic, card-based interactive experience.
	5.	Distribute those experiences as:
	•	A self-contained immersive link (primary sales asset)
	•	A simple embed inside existing websites (script or iframe)

Core belief:

Experiences replace websites and PDFs as the primary surface for explanation and sales.

Your Tasks

Please evaluate this system from a builder’s perspective, covering:

1. Architecture sanity
	•	Is the separation between micro-smart site, intelligence engine, and experience layer clean?
	•	What would you modularise first?

2. Feasibility & Scope
	•	What is realistically buildable as an MVP?
	•	What would you defer without killing the core value?

3. Embed & Distribution
	•	Best technical approach for:
	•	Self-contained experience links
	•	Website embeds that remain performant and secure
	•	Any major gotchas?

4. Data & Intelligence Flow
	•	How would you structure ingestion of URLs, posts, and documents?
	•	What should be indexed vs summarised vs stored raw?

5. Risk & Complexity
	•	Where could this spiral into over-engineering?
	•	What assumptions should be challenged early?

⸻

Final Output Required

End with:
	•	Build / Simplify / Re-scope recommendation
	•	A short explanation
	•	A suggested first build milestone that proves the concept works

Be practical. Avoid buzzwords. Optimise for speed and clarity.

Why this prompt works
	•	It keeps Replit in engineering reality
	•	It forces MVP discipline
	•	It will naturally surface whether:
	•	This wants to be multiple services
	•	Or one tight, opinionated system

If you want, after Replit responds we can:
	•	Convert the response into a build plan
	•	Write the actual Replit scaffold prompt
	•	Or decide what not to build (which will save you weeks)

Good catch correcting that — and yes, this is exactly the right moment to ask Replit rather than keep theorising.
