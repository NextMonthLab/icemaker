Absolutely. Here’s a copy-paste prompt to update Replit with the latest locked language, separation, and the new cloud-build / local-power architecture.

Replit Update Prompt

Project: NextMonth – Orbit + ICE (Language Locked, Architecture Updated)

Context

We’ve refined the product structure and are now locking in language and boundaries. Please treat this as the new ground truth and re-review feasibility and build approach accordingly.

⸻

Locked Product Definitions

Product 1: Orbit – Orbital Intelligence Viewer

Audience: Businesses (primary), Educators (secondary)

Orbit is a public-facing, explorable intelligence view of a business presented as a grid of “intelligence boxes” (signals), such as:
	•	Website pages
	•	Blogs/newsletters
	•	PDFs
	•	Testimonials/proof
	•	Social posts (later)

Public users can explore but cannot edit.

⸻

Product 1a: Orbital Intelligence Viewer – Business Hub

This is the logged-in business version of Orbit.

Key rule:

Business sees the same public Orbit view, plus a sidebar (no separate admin page).

Sidebar capabilities (curation-only, not CMS editing):
	•	Add new grid boxes (start small: URL, PDF, testimonial, text)
	•	Connect sources (social later)
	•	Highlight/prioritise/curate what represents the business best
	•	Finite brand inputs (logo, accent colour, tone)

⸻

Product 2: ICE – Interactive Cinematic Experiences

Audience: Creators (ICE-only), Businesses, Educators

ICE is the only expressive output format:
	•	Card-based, cinematic, interactive
	•	Shareable as a self-contained link
	•	Embeddable via safe iframe/script (later)

Creators primarily use ICE without Orbit.

⸻

Creation Bridge: ICE Maker

ICE Maker is not a third product.

In Business Hub:
	•	Any Orbit grid box can be clicked/dragged into the ICE Maker
	•	This triggers an express 5-step ICE creation flow
	•	Rule: If it’s in Orbit, it can become an ICE

⸻

Orbit State Model (Freemium)

Unclaimed Orbit Preview (Public)

Businesses start with an AI-generated preview from their website that is public and shareable, but:
	•	Heavily “Powered by NextMonth” branded
	•	Strong CTA: “Claim this Orbit”
	•	Strictly limited interactions
	•	No sidebar
	•	No expansion/curation
	•	No ICE Maker from grid boxes

Claimed Orbit (Public + Owner Sidebar)

Claiming attaches ownership and unlocks Business Hub sidebar + ICE Maker bridge. No reset or blank start.

⸻

Updated Architecture: Cloud Builds, Local Powers

We want to use:
	•	Cloud LLM to build and periodically refresh a structured Orbit Pack (snapshot)
	•	Local LLM to power day-to-day Orbit interactions using that Orbit Pack

Orbit Pack (Cloud-generated canonical snapshot)

Contains:
	•	Grid box definitions + metadata
	•	Extracted themes/entities/services
	•	FAQs
	•	Card-ready micro-summaries
	•	Proof snippets
	•	Tags/topics + a lightweight index
	•	“Visual Bible” constraints (tone/style rules)

This pack is versioned and is the source of truth.

Local LLM (runs on-device or small self-hosted model)

Uses the Orbit Pack to:
	•	Answer questions (“Orbit narrator”)
	•	Summarise boxes
	•	Suggest guided tours
	•	Draft ICE content quickly from the prepared snippets (Express mode)

Optional upgrade action:
	•	“Polish with Studio Intelligence” (cloud) to improve final ICE copy and structure.

⸻

What We Want You To Do
	1.	Re-review feasibility and architecture based on this updated model.
	2.	Propose the cleanest implementation approach for:
	•	Orbit Pack generation + storage + versioning
	•	Local model interaction layer that relies on the Orbit Pack (no raw-source parsing locally)
	3.	Recommend which “local” approach is best for MVP:
	•	On-device WebLLM/WebGPU
	•	Or small open model on our servers
	4.	Re-suggest a build sequence (2–3 milestones) that fits this architecture without scope creep.

Avoid:
	•	Full social OAuth initially
	•	Advanced analytics initially
	•	Team permissions initially
	•	CMS-style page editing

Output required:
	•	Updated architecture summary
	•	MVP milestone plan
	•	Key risks + mitigations

If you want, tell me whether you’re treating “local LLM” as on-device or our-server open model and I’ll tailor the prompt even tighter (and choose the right constraints).
