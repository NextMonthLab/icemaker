Absolutely. Here’s the message addressed directly to RoClaires, ready to paste into your Replit thread.

Hi RoClaires, we need to reimagine the IceMaker Library page so it looks launch-ready, but we’re keeping scope very tight (no templates yet).

Goal

Make the Library feel like a polished, dedicated IceMaker command centre:
	•	Clear what to do first
	•	No confusing “insight” language
	•	Clean empty state
	•	Simple Drafts/Published organisation
	•	No big feature creep (no tagging/folders/analytics/templates for now)

Key change: remove “Create from Insight”

“Insight” won’t mean anything to users. Replace it everywhere on this page with a plain-English flow.

New primary CTA

Top right: New ICE

Clicking New ICE opens a small modal with just 2 options:
	1.	Create from source (recommended)
	•	CTA: Upload file or paste link
	•	Helper: PDFs, slides, documents, or a web page.
	2.	Start from scratch
	•	CTA: Start blank ICE
	•	Helper: Build your own scenes and interactions.

That’s it. No extra options for v1.

Tabs

Keep only:
	•	Drafts (count)
	•	Published (count)

Remove/hide Templates tab for now. It makes the page feel unfinished.

Empty state (Drafts)

Replace “Your Library is empty” with something more intentional:

Create your first ICE
Turn a document, deck, or web page into an interactive experience in minutes.

Buttons:
	•	Primary: Create from source
	•	Secondary: Start from scratch

Small helper line under buttons:
Popular sources: onboarding packs, SOPs, policy updates, training notes.

Empty state (Published)

Different message so it feels deliberate:

Nothing published yet
Publish an ICE to share it with your audience.

Button:
	•	Go to Drafts

When items exist: minimal ICE cards

Each ICE card/list row should show just enough to feel real:
	•	Title
	•	Status pill: Draft or Published
	•	Meta: Last edited X days ago
	•	Optional if easy: 8 scenes or ~6 min

Actions (3-dot menu):
	•	Open
	•	Duplicate
	•	Delete (Drafts only) / Unpublish (Published optional)

Primary click: Open

Small polish (safe, low effort)
	•	One subtle empty-state icon (document → spark → ICE)
	•	Status pills styled cleanly
	•	Keep UI spacing confident so it doesn’t feel like a placeholder screen

MVP implementation order
	1.	Remove Templates tab
	2.	Replace “Create from Insight” with New ICE modal (2 options)
	3.	New empty state copy + CTAs
	4.	ICE cards (title/status/last edited)

That should get the page looking production-ready without drifting into bigger features.
