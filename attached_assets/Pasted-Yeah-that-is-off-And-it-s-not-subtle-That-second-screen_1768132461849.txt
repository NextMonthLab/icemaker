Yeah – that is off. And it’s not subtle. That second screenshot is doing a “primary school syllable exercise”:
	•	As
	•	generativ
	•	AI too…

That means the browser is still being allowed (or forced) to break inside a normal English word. With only a few words on screen, that should basically never happen.

There are only a handful of ways this can occur:

What’s causing it (most likely)

1) You still have a “break anywhere / break all” rule applied somewhere

Even if you set hyphens: none, the browser will still split words if any of these are active on the text or a parent:
	•	word-break: break-all  ✅ will split generative into generativ / e
	•	overflow-wrap: anywhere ✅ allows splits literally anywhere
	•	line-break: anywhere ✅ similar
	•	Tailwind classes: break-all, break-words (break-words is usually OK, break-all is not)

Action: search the codebase for:
	•	break-all
	•	overflowWrap: 'anywhere'
	•	lineBreak: 'anywhere'
	•	wordBreak: 'break-all'

If any of those exist in the caption tree, that’s your culprit.

What we’re going to do about words not fitting

We do not fix “doesn’t fit” by letting words break mid-word. That’s a last resort for URLs.

We fix it with a predictable rule set:
	1.	Never break normal words
	2.	Prefer 2 lines
	3.	If it doesn’t fit: widen the panel
	4.	If it still doesn’t fit: reduce font size slightly
	5.	Only for extreme long tokens (URLs/hashtags): allow break-word

That’s the CapCut contract.

The exact CSS contract to apply (copy/paste)

Apply this directly on the <p> that is clamped (headline):

const headlineStyle: React.CSSProperties = {
  // your existing font, size, weight, shadows etc

  whiteSpace: 'normal',

  // 🔒 DO NOT allow mid-word breaking
  wordBreak: 'keep-all',      // key change
  overflowWrap: 'normal',     // key change

  // 🔒 No hyphenation
  hyphens: 'none',
};

Then add a safety override only for “unbreakable” tokens (URLs etc).
You can do this without fancy measurement:

const longestWord = Math.max(...headline.split(/\s+/).map(w => w.length));

if (longestWord >= 18) {
  headlineStyle.wordBreak = 'normal';
  headlineStyle.overflowWrap = 'break-word';
}

This gives you:
	•	normal phrases never split (“generative” stays intact)
	•	genuinely long tokens still won’t overflow the box

Do the same for supporting text.

Then fix “it doesn’t fit” the right way

If you apply keep-all, short phrases will wrap at spaces only. If your panel is too narrow, you’ll get ugly single-word lines (“As” on its own).

So you widen + scale.

Panel width rule (simple and effective)

In panelStyle:
	•	default: maxWidth: '92%'
	•	if wordCount <= 6: maxWidth: '96%'

Font scale rule
	•	if wordCount <= 6 and you’re getting 3 lines: reduce font size by 8–12%

You don’t even need measuring to get 90% there.

One quick diagnostic to prove it

In dev tools (or by logging resolved styles), check the computed style for the headline <p>.

If you see either:
	•	word-break: break-all
	•	overflow-wrap: anywhere

…that explains the screenshot immediately.

Why I’m confident this is the right next step

Because “generativ” isn’t a natural wrap result. It’s an explicit mid-word break policy being applied.

Once we lock wordBreak: keep-all + widen panel slightly + small font scale, those captions will look instantly more premium.

If you paste your current resolved headlineStyle + panelStyle objects (just the final outputs), I’ll point to the exact property that’s still poisoning the layout.
