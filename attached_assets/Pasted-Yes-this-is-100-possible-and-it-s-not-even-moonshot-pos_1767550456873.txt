Yes, this is 100% possible, and it’s not even “moonshot possible”. It’s the normal way serious short-form tools do typography.

Right now ICE is giving users a box of Lego and asking them to design a cathedral. Title packs are the cathedral.

What’s realistically possible (and what level you can reach)

✅ Easy win (MVP-grade, but already TikTok-worthy)
	•	5–8 Title Packs selectable from a gallery
	•	Each pack defines:
	•	font pairing, weights, tracking
	•	colour palette (primary + accent)
	•	placement (safe zone + alignment)
	•	background/label shapes (pill, box, tape, underline)
	•	text effects (stroke, shadow, glow)
	•	Pack applies automatically to all cards
	•	Text auto-wrap + auto-scale to fit the template

This alone will take ICE from “generator” to “product”.

✅ Next level (CapCut-ish)
	•	Per-card “moment variants” inside the same pack (eg. “Impact”, “Quote”, “Reveal”)
	•	Animated in/out for text and shapes (fade, slide, pop, type-on)
	•	Auto-emphasis rules (highlight a keyword, split into headline + subline)

⚠️ Harder (but doable later)
	•	AI choosing a pack per story mood
	•	Beat-synced kinetic typography (music-driven)
	•	Complex masking behind subjects (needs segmentation / depth or manual hints)

So: start with packs + smart fitting + a few animations. That’s 80% of the perceived quality.

The key decision you’ve made (and it’s correct)

Removing manual font/colour selection is the right call for mainstream users.

Give them:
	•	Pick a pack
	•	(Optional) pick a mood or intensity
	•	Everything else is handled

That’s how you get consistency and “looks pro even when user has no taste”. (No offence to humanity, but… have you seen PowerPoint?)

The 5 Title Packs I’d ship first

These map directly to what you described (grungy, cinematic, high-energy, bold) and what your screenshot is aiming at.
	1.	Neon Impact
	•	Big uppercase headline, thick stroke + glow
	•	Neon accent blocks (pink/cyan)
	•	Great for hooks, bold statements
	2.	Cinematic Subtitles
	•	Lower-third framing, subtle letterbox vibe
	•	Soft drop shadow, restrained palette
	•	Perfect for narration-driven ICE
	3.	Grunge Tape
	•	“Sticker/tape” labels behind words
	•	Rough edges, distressed overlays (lightweight textures)
	•	Feels street / raw / documentary
	4.	Editorial Minimal
	•	Clean modern layout, high whitespace
	•	Thin accent line + small tag
	•	Great for premium brand stories
	5.	Hyper Cut (High Energy)
	•	Angled shapes, diagonal slashes, punchy colour
	•	Two-line kinetic layout (headline + punchline)
	•	Best for fast TikTok pacing

Optional 6th if you want a crowd-pleaser:
	•	VHS Glitch (chromatic aberration, scanlines, “REC” icon) for retro vibes

What makes packs actually work: smart text fitting

Without this, packs look great in thumbnails and awful in real use.

You need three behaviours:
	1.	Auto hierarchy
	•	Generated text is split into: headline + supporting line
	•	Rule of thumb: first sentence becomes headline, remainder becomes supporting
	•	Or if short: everything becomes headline
	2.	Auto wrap
	•	Wrap to max lines (eg. headline max 2 lines, supporting max 3)
	3.	Auto scale
	•	Scale down within limits, then reflow
	•	If still too long: split into two beats (same card) or suggest new card

⸻

Implementation approach (simple + robust)

Represent each Title Pack as a JSON template:
	•	canvas: 1080x1920
	•	safe zones (top 20%, bottom 20%)
	•	layers:
	•	headlineText
	•	supportText
	•	accentShape
	•	badgeTag (optional)
	•	textureOverlay (optional)
	•	per-layer properties:
	•	fontFamily, weight, sizeMin/Max
	•	colour tokens (primary/accent)
	•	x/y anchor + alignment
	•	stroke/shadow/glow settings
	•	animation preset (optional)

Then the render pipeline:
	1.	compute text groups
	2.	measure + wrap
	3.	fit to bounding box
	4.	render layers in order
	5.	export frame/video

Font licensing note: use open-licence fonts (Google Fonts etc) for MVP so you don’t get bitten later.

Your “Day 1/2/3” point

Bin it. It screams template system.

If you need structure later, reintroduce as an optional pack element (eg. “Episode Tag” or “Chapter Marker”) but not default.

Copy-paste guidance to send to RAPTLIV

If you want something you can drop straight into the prompt:

Title Packs upgrade request
	•	Replace manual font + colour picking with a Title Packs system (5 packs minimum).
	•	Each pack is a template that defines typography, colours, graphical accents, and placement on 1080x1920 cards.
	•	Packs must auto-apply to generated text with smart fitting:
	•	Split generated text into headline + supporting line
	•	Auto wrap and auto-scale to fit template bounds
	•	If text exceeds limits, split into 2 beats or suggest splitting into another card
	•	Add basic animations per pack (optional MVP):
	•	Fade/slide/pop/type-on, plus shape reveals
	•	Remove “Day 1/2/3” badge from cards for now.
	•	Ensure packs are TikTok-ready: bold, cinematic, grunge, high-energy, minimal/editorial.

If you want, I can also write the exact pack specs (fonts, sizes, bounding boxes, effects) in a ready-to-implement JSON structure, so RAPTLIV can build it without interpretation.
