Perfect. This is exactly the right moment to re-brief RatPlan with authority, not uncertainty.

Below is a clean, locked-in prompt you can paste straight into RatPlan. It reflects the decisions you’ve made, the language you’re freezing, and what you want reviewed next.

RatPlan Re-Review Prompt

Project: NextMonth – Orbit + ICE Architecture (Language Locked)

Context Update (Important)

We’ve progressed the thinking and are now locking in language, separation, and product boundaries. This is no longer exploratory.

Please re-review the system based on the clarified structure below and assess:
	•	What already exists
	•	What needs adjustment
	•	How you would proceed with building the remaining pieces cleanly

⸻

Locked Product Definitions (Do Not Reinterpret)

Product 1: Orbit – Orbital Intelligence Viewer

Audience: Businesses (primary), Educators (secondary)

Orbit is a public-facing intelligence view of a business.
	•	It presents a grid-based, explorable view of:
	•	Curated content
	•	Proof
	•	Thinking
	•	Signals
	•	It is calm, transparent, and credibility-led
	•	No editing controls are visible to the public

⸻

Product 1a: Orbital Intelligence Viewer – Business Hub

This is the logged-in business version of Orbit.

Key rule:

The business sees exactly what the public sees, plus a sidebar.

The Business Hub sidebar allows the business to:
	•	Add new grid boxes (blogs, pages, PDFs, testimonials, newsletters, etc.)
	•	Connect social media accounts
	•	Highlight or prioritise specific items
	•	Curate what best represents their brand identity
	•	Manage finite brand inputs (logo, accent colour, tone)

This is not a CMS.
This is not a dashboard.
This is an intelligence curation layer.

⸻

Product 2: ICE – Interactive Cinematic Experience

Audience: Creators, Educators, Businesses

ICE is the only expressive output format:
	•	Card-based
	•	Cinematic
	•	Interactive
	•	Shareable as a self-contained link
	•	Embeddable on external websites

Creators primarily use ICE directly.
Businesses use ICE as their outbound storytelling and sales surface.

⸻

Creation Bridge: ICE Maker

ICE Maker is not a third product.

For businesses:
	•	ICE Maker lives inside the Orbital Intelligence Viewer Business Hub
	•	Any grid box in Orbit can be:
	•	Clicked or dragged
	•	Sent into the ICE Maker
	•	This triggers an express 5-step ICE creation flow
	•	All generation capabilities are equivalent to the standalone ICE generator

Rule:

If it’s in Orbit, it can become an ICE.

What We Want You to Do

1. Re-evaluate What’s Already Built
	•	What components already align with this structure?
	•	What needs renaming vs reworking?
	•	What should be removed or merged?

2. Business Hub Construction
	•	How would you implement the public Orbit + private sidebar model cleanly?
	•	How would you manage permissions and state without duplicating views?

3. ICE Maker Integration
	•	How should drag-to-ICE-Maker or click-to-ICE-Maker work technically?
	•	How do we ensure zero context loss when initiating ICE creation?

4. Architecture Discipline
	•	Where must we be careful not to reintroduce CMS or builder complexity?
	•	What should explicitly not be built yet?

⸻

Output Required

Please respond with:
	1.	A revised architecture summary using the locked language above
	2.	A component map (what exists, what’s missing)
	3.	A recommended next build sequence (2–3 milestones max)
	4.	Any critical risks or simplifications you would apply now that the separation is clear

Do not rebrand.
Do not merge products.
Do not invent additional layers.

⸻

Why this matters

We are deliberately converging on:
	•	One intelligence hub
	•	Two outputs
	•	One creation bridge

Your job is to help us finish this cleanly and coherently, not expand it.

⸻

If you want, once RatPlan responds, I can:
	•	Translate its answer into a concrete build plan
	•	Spot where it’s overengineering
	•	Or help you write the internal “this is now locked” note so the team doesn’t drift again

This is a good moment. You’ve done the hard thinking. Now you’re enforcing clarity.
