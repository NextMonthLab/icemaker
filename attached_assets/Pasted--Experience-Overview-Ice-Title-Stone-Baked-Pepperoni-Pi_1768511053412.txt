|1.1 |Today, we’re making proper stone-baked pepperoni pizza completely from scratch. And I promise you – if you can stir and squish, you can do this. Let’s get everything ready. You’ll need: 500g strong bread flour, 325ml warm water (not hot – think baby bath temperature), 7g dried yeast, 10g salt, and a tablespoon of olive oil. That’s it. Simple ingredients, magic results.          |IMAGE: Bird’s eye view looking straight down at a rustic wooden preparation board, mise en place arrangement of pizza dough ingredients: small ceramic bowl of white flour (500g) piled in centre, glass measuring jug with warm water, tiny bowl of dried yeast granules, small dish of coarse sea salt, glass bottle of golden olive oil, scattered flour dust on wooden surface, warm golden-hour lighting from side, professional food photography, shallow depth of field, rustic Italian farmhouse kitchen aesthetic, 4K, photorealistic|
|1.2 |First, let’s wake up the yeast. Pour your warm water into a bowl and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Now just leave it alone for about 5 minutes. You’ll see it start to foam and bubble – that’s the yeast coming to life. If nothing happens, your water was probably too hot or too cold. No stress, just try again with fresh yeast and water that feels warm but not hot on your wrist.|IMAGE: Bird’s eye view looking straight down at a cream ceramic bowl containing warm water with dried yeast sprinkled on surface, tiny bubbles beginning to form and foam developing, wooden spoon resting beside bowl, flour-dusted rustic wooden board beneath, warm golden lighting, sense of anticipation and chemistry happening, professional food photography, shallow depth of field on edges, rustic artisan kitchen, 4K, photorealistic                                                                                             |
|1.3 |While the yeast does its thing, let’s prep the flour. Tip it onto your board and make a well in the middle – like a little volcano. Now here’s a tip: sprinkle your salt around the outer edge of the flour, away from where the yeast water will go. Salt and yeast aren’t best friends when they first meet, so we keep them apart until they’re mixed into the dough.                     |IMAGE: Bird’s eye view looking straight down at a mound of white flour on wooden board with a well created in the centre, coarse salt crystals visible scattered around the outer edge of the flour, hands visible at the edges of frame dusted with flour, rustic wooden surface with natural grain visible, warm golden-hour side lighting casting soft shadows, professional food photography, Italian farmhouse kitchen aesthetic, 4K, photorealistic                                                                                     |
|1.4 |Your yeast should be lovely and foamy now. Pour it right into the well, add your olive oil, and grab a fork. Starting from the centre, begin mixing in small circles, gradually pulling in flour from the edges. It’s going to look messy and shaggy – that’s perfect. Don’t worry about getting it smooth yet, we just want everything roughly combined.                                    |VIDEO (5s loop): Bird’s eye view looking straight down, silver fork mixing shaggy pizza dough in circular motion from centre outward, flour gradually incorporating into wet mixture, yeasty water and olive oil combining with flour, messy but purposeful mixing action, flour dust particles visible in warm golden light, rustic wooden board beneath, hands holding fork visible, professional food videography, smooth continuous motion, rustic Italian kitchen, 4K, cinematic                                                         |
|1.5 |Now the fun part – kneading. Get your hands in there and bring it together into a rough ball. Then push it away from you with the heel of your hand, fold it back, turn it a quarter, and repeat. Do this for about 10 minutes. Yes, really – it’s a workout! You’ll feel the dough transform from sticky and rough to smooth and elastic. When you poke it and it springs back, you’re done.|VIDEO (5s seamless loop): Bird’s eye view looking straight down, hands kneading smooth elastic pizza dough on flour-dusted wooden surface, push-fold-turn motion repeated rhythmically, dough ball becoming smoother and more cohesive, flour dust rising slightly with each push, warm golden-hour lighting, professional food videography, satisfying ASMR quality, continuous seamless loop, rustic Italian kitchen aesthetic, 4K, cinematic                                                                                               |
|1.6 |Beautiful work. Now your dough needs to rest and rise. Rub a clean bowl with a little olive oil, pop your dough ball in, and cover it with a damp tea towel. Find a warm spot in your kitchen and leave it alone for 1-2 hours. You’re looking for it to double in size. This is a great time to clean up, prep your toppings, or put your feet up. You’ve earned it.                        |IMAGE: Bird’s eye view looking straight down at a smooth round pizza dough ball resting in a ceramic bowl lightly coated with olive oil, dough surface slightly shiny, white linen cloth draped beside the bowl ready to cover, rustic wooden table surface, warm golden-hour lighting suggesting patience and time passing, sense of potential and anticipation, professional food photography, Italian farmhouse kitchen aesthetic, cosy and inviting, 4K, photorealistic                                                                   |

Chef Marco available to answer questions about: yeast activation, kneading technique, proving times, troubleshooting sticky or dry dough. Example Q&A - User: “My dough is really sticky, did I mess up?” Chef: “That’s completely normal! Sticky dough is actually a good sign – it means there’s enough hydration for a lovely, airy crust. Just dust your hands and the surface with a little more flour as you knead. You’re doing great!”

# Stage 2: Rolling & Preparing

|2.1 |Right, let’s check on that dough. It should have doubled in size and look all puffy and pillowy. Give it a poke – if the indent stays and doesn’t spring right back, it’s ready. See those little bubbles on the surface? That’s all the air that’s going to give you a lovely light crust. Your patience has paid off.                                                                                    |IMAGE: Bird’s eye view looking straight down at beautifully risen pizza dough doubled in size in ceramic bowl, single finger pressing into pillowy surface creating visible indent that stays, dough puffy and airy with slight bubbles visible on surface, warm golden-hour lighting, sense of achievement and readiness, professional food photography, rustic Italian kitchen, flour-dusted wooden table beneath, 4K, photorealistic                                                   |
|2.2 |Now we knock it back – don’t worry, it sounds more violent than it is. Just push your fist gently into the centre of the dough. You’ll hear and feel the air releasing. It’s oddly satisfying, isn’t it? This redistributes the yeast and gets the dough ready for shaping. Tip it out onto a floured surface.                                                                                             |VIDEO (3s): Bird’s eye view looking straight down, fist gently punching into centre of puffy risen pizza dough in ceramic bowl, air visibly releasing as dough deflates satisfyingly, dough collapsing softly around the fist, warm golden-hour lighting, professional food videography, satisfying deflation moment, rustic Italian kitchen aesthetic, 4K, cinematic                                                                                                                     |
|2.3 |Time to shape your base. Forget the rolling pin – we’re using our hands like proper pizzaiolos. Press down from the centre and push outward, rotating as you go. You’re aiming for about 12 inches across, with the edges slightly thicker than the middle. That thick edge becomes your crust. Don’t stress about making it perfectly round – rustic and delicious beats perfect and stressful every time.|VIDEO (5s loop): Bird’s eye view looking straight down, hands stretching pizza dough outward from centre, rotating quarter turn, dough expanding and thinning visibly, gentle stretching motion, flour-dusted wooden board beneath, dough transforming from ball to flat round shape, warm golden-hour lighting, professional food videography, skilled but approachable technique, rustic Italian kitchen, 4K, cinematic                                                                 |
|2.4 |Sauce time – and less is more here, trust me. Spoon about 3-4 tablespoons of passata or crushed tomatoes into the centre, then spread it outward with the back of the spoon in a spiral motion. Leave about an inch of bare dough around the edge. Too much sauce makes everything soggy. You want just enough to taste in every bite.                                                                     |IMAGE: Bird’s eye view looking straight down at stretched pizza base on wooden board, silver spoon spreading vibrant red tomato passata sauce in circular motion, sauce partially spread with some base still visible, clear 1-inch border of pale dough around edge, small bowl of remaining sauce visible at edge of frame, warm golden-hour lighting, professional food photography, appetising rich red colour contrast against pale dough, rustic Italian kitchen, 4K, photorealistic|
|2.5 |Now the cheese. Grab your mozzarella and tear it into rough pieces – tearing gives you better texture than slicing. Scatter them evenly across the sauce. Some bigger bits, some smaller bits. When it melts, you’ll get those gorgeous pools of cheese with slightly crispy edges. Don’t go right to the edge – leave a little border.                                                                    |IMAGE: Bird’s eye view looking straight down at pizza base covered in red tomato sauce, torn pieces of fresh white mozzarella scattered across the surface, creamy cheese contrasting beautifully with red sauce, some pieces larger and some smaller for rustic look, clean dough border visible around edge, wooden board beneath, warm golden-hour lighting, professional food photography, appetising and inviting, Italian farmhouse kitchen, 4K, photorealistic                     |
|2.6 |Final touch before the oven – pepperoni. Lay them out in a single layer, slight overlap is fine. About 50-60g should do it. They’ll crisp up beautifully in the oven, the edges will curl, and the oils will run into the cheese. Look at that. You made this. From flour and water. Take a moment – you should be proud.                                                                                  |IMAGE: Bird’s eye view looking straight down at complete uncooked pizza ready for oven, red pepperoni circles arranged in appealing pattern over white mozzarella and red sauce, slight overlap between some pepperoni slices, perfect clean raised dough edge visible, wooden pizza board beneath, warm golden-hour lighting, professional food photography, mouth-watering anticipation of cooking, rustic Italian kitchen aesthetic, 4K, photorealistic                                |

Chef Marco available to answer questions about: dough thickness, why dough springs back, sauce quantity, whether pepperoni goes under or over cheese. Example Q&A - User: “How thin should the base be?” Chef: “For a nice stone-baked style, aim for about 3-4mm in the centre – thin enough to see light through if you held it up, but not paper thin. The edges should be a bit thicker to give you that lovely puffy crust. Don’t worry if it’s not perfectly round – rustic is beautiful!”

|3.1 |Here’s the secret to great homemade pizza: a screaming hot oven. Crank yours up to maximum – usually around 250°C or 480°F. If you’ve got a pizza stone, put it in now. No stone? A heavy baking tray flipped upside down works great. Let it heat for a full 30 minutes. I know it feels like a long time, but that hot surface is what gives you a crispy base.    |IMAGE: Side angle view of open oven door, pizza stone visible inside glowing with heat, heat shimmer effect visible in the air, warm orange glow from oven interior, kitchen setting visible in background soft focus, sense of intense heat and preparation, professional food photography, dramatic lighting contrast between cool kitchen and hot oven, rustic Italian kitchen with modern oven, 4K, photorealistic|
|3.2 |This is the moment of truth – getting your pizza onto that hot stone. If you’ve got a pizza peel, great. If not, use a flat baking tray or the back of a chopping board dusted with flour. Slide the pizza off in one confident motion. Don’t hesitate – commit to it! The flour helps it glide right off. Close that oven door quickly to keep the heat in.         |VIDEO (3s): Side angle view, wooden pizza peel sliding uncooked pepperoni pizza onto hot pizza stone inside oven, smooth confident motion, pizza transferring from peel to stone, flour dust visible, heat shimmer in oven, warm orange glow from oven interior, professional food videography, skilled moment of transfer, dramatic lighting, kitchen setting, 4K, cinematic                                         |
|3.3 |Now watch the magic happen. In 8-12 minutes, your pizza will transform. The cheese will melt and start bubbling, the crust will puff up and turn golden, and you’ll see those beautiful charred spots appearing on the edges. The pepperoni will crisp and curl at the edges. Your kitchen is going to smell incredible. Keep an eye on it – every oven is different.|VIDEO (5s time-lapse): Side angle view inside oven, pepperoni pizza on stone, cheese melting and beginning to bubble, crust edges puffing and turning golden, pepperoni curling slightly at edges, time-lapse acceleration feel showing transformation, heat shimmer, warm orange oven glow, professional food videography, mesmerising cooking process, appetising transformation, 4K, cinematic                     |
|3.4 |Want to know if it’s really done? Lift the edge with a spatula and check the bottom. You’re looking for golden-brown and firm – not pale and soft. The cheese should be bubbling with some golden spots, and the crust should have some colour. If the top looks done but the bottom is pale, give it another minute or two. Trust your eyes more than the timer.    |IMAGE: Side angle view, metal spatula lifting edge of pizza in oven to reveal golden-brown crispy underside, perfectly cooked base visible, cheese still bubbling on top, crust beautifully coloured, heat shimmer and warm orange oven glow, professional food photography, moment of checking doneness, anticipation of success, 4K, photorealistic                                                                 |
|3.5 |It’s ready. Slide it out onto a wooden board – careful, it’s hot! Look at that beauty. The cheese still bubbling, the crust puffed and golden, those pepperoni edges perfectly crisped. You did this. From a bag of flour and some simple ingredients, you created something amazing. But hold on – don’t cut it just yet.                                           |IMAGE: Bird’s eye view looking straight down at freshly baked pepperoni pizza just placed on rustic wooden board, steam rising visibly from hot surface, cheese still bubbling slightly, golden-brown crust with charred spots, pepperoni crispy at edges, beautiful caramelisation, warm golden-hour lighting, professional food photography, triumph moment, rustic Italian kitchen, 4K, photorealistic             |

|4.1 |I know it’s tempting, but give it 2 minutes to rest. The cheese needs a moment to set slightly – otherwise it’ll slide right off when you cut. Plus, molten cheese burns are no joke. Use this time to grab your plates, pour yourself a drink, and admire your handiwork. You’ve earned this moment.                                                  |IMAGE: Bird’s eye view looking straight down at whole freshly baked pepperoni pizza resting on rustic wooden board, gentle steam rising and dissipating, cheese slightly settled but still molten-looking, golden crust with perfect char spots, moment of patience before cutting, warm golden-hour lighting, professional food photography, anticipation and restraint, rustic Italian farmhouse kitchen, 4K, photorealistic                          |
|4.2 |Cutting time. If you’ve got a pizza wheel, use a firm rolling motion – don’t drag. No wheel? A large sharp knife with a rocking motion works fine. Go for 6 slices if you’re hungry, 8 if you’re sharing. Cut right through with confidence. Listen to that sound – crispy base, perfect texture.                                                      |VIDEO (4s): Bird’s eye view looking straight down, pizza cutting wheel rolling through pepperoni pizza creating clean slice, cheese stretching slightly then separating, decisive cutting motion, multiple cuts creating 8 slices, wooden board beneath, warm golden-hour lighting, professional food videography, satisfying cutting action, ASMR quality, rustic Italian kitchen, 4K, cinematic                                                       |
|4.3 |Now if you want to take it up a notch – and this is optional but highly recommended – tear some fresh basil leaves over the top, drizzle with a little olive oil, maybe a pinch of chilli flakes if you like heat. These finishing touches add freshness and make it look like it came from a proper pizzeria. Because it basically did. Your pizzeria.|IMAGE: Bird’s eye view looking straight down at sliced pepperoni pizza on wooden board, hand scattering fresh green basil leaves across the top, golden olive oil drizzle captured mid-pour glistening in light, red chilli flakes visible in small dish nearby, finishing touches being applied, warm golden-hour lighting, professional food photography, final flourish moment, vibrant colours, rustic Italian farmhouse kitchen, 4K, photorealistic|
|4.4 |This is it. The moment. Grab a slice – go on, lift it up. Look at that cheese pull. That’s the sign of a properly made pizza. You started with flour and water, and now you’re holding this. Take a bite while it’s hot. Pizza waits for no one. Congratulations – you just made restaurant-quality pizza in your own kitchen. Welcome to the club.    |VIDEO (3s slow-mo): Bird’s eye view looking straight down, hand lifting single slice of pepperoni pizza from whole pie, dramatic cheese pull stretching between slice and remaining pizza, golden strings of melted mozzarella, steam rising, slow motion capture, moment of ultimate satisfaction, warm golden-hour lighting, professional food videography, hero shot money moment, appetite appeal maximum, rustic Italian kitchen, 4K, cinematic    |

## AI Checkpoint

Chef Marco available for: celebrating success, storage tips for leftovers, variations to try next time, encouragement to share creation. Example Q&A - User: “Can I freeze leftover dough?” Chef: “Great question! Yes, absolutely. After the first prove, knock it back, wrap tightly in cling film, and freeze for up to 3 months. When you want pizza, move it to the fridge overnight to thaw, then let it come to room temperature for an hour before shaping. You’ve just set yourself up for future pizza nights – well done!”
