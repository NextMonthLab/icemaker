You’re right to be paranoid here. Products like this can look “alive” while quietly running on placeholders, seeded arrays, or hard-coded summaries. The way you avoid self-delusion is you run a truth audit: every step must prove it’s backed by real events, real storage, and real endpoints.

Below is the exact way to interrogate Raplet so it has to show evidence (not vibes), plus a manual smoke test you can do in 10 minutes to validate with your own eyes.

⸻

The holy grail flow you want to verify
	1.	Claim Orbit (and power-up sources)
	2.	Traffic arrives (real visitors hit the Orbit entrypoints)
	3.	Events are recorded (views, sessions, interactions)
	4.	Intelligence is generated (insights derived from those events + sources)
	5.	Insights show in Launchpad (no mock)
	6.	Make Ice from insight → Draft saved
	7.	Draft opens in Amalgamated Editor
	8.	Publish and views accrue
	9.	Loop feeds back into Orbit signal + new insights

How to interrogate Raplet properly

Rule: it must answer with evidence

For every claim, Raplet must provide:
	•	Exact route paths
	•	Exact file paths
	•	Exact DB tables/columns
	•	Example API responses (real JSON shape)
	•	Where “real data” comes from (queries / storage calls)

If it can’t, it’s not connected.

Copy/paste this to Raplet (Truth Audit Prompt Pack)

RAPLET: END-TO-END TRUTH AUDIT (No mock data allowed)

Goal
Prove the entire Orbit → Intelligence → Ice → Editor → Publish loop is functional and backed by real data.
For each section, provide:
1) route paths
2) file paths
3) database tables/columns (or storage)
4) actual API response examples (shape)
5) clear statement: REAL / STUB / MOCK

SECTION 1 — Claim + Power-Up Sources
A) What endpoints persist power-up sources?
- Show server route handler file path and storage function called.
- Show tables used (orbit_sources or equivalent).
B) Where is orbit status stored (basic vs powered)?
- Show exact schema field and update location.
C) How does Launchpad read orbit status and strengthScore?
- Show file path and data mapping.

SECTION 2 — Traffic + Event Tracking (real visitors)
A) What public endpoint/page receives traffic?
- Is it an Orbit page, embed script, published ice viewer, etc. Provide URL route(s).
B) What events are captured and where stored?
- List event types (pageview, session_start, interaction, etc).
- Show table(s) + example row shape.
C) Show the code location where events are written.
- File path + function name.

SECTION 3 — Signal Metrics (Launchpad tiles)
A) For each tile (Visits, Conversations, Ice Views, Leads):
- Which API endpoint feeds it?
- What table/query feeds it?
- Show example JSON response.
B) Confirm none of these are hardcoded numbers or seeded.
- Provide proof by pointing to the DB query or aggregation code.

SECTION 4 — Insights Generation (no placeholders)
A) What endpoint serves /api/orbit/:slug/insights (or equivalent)?
- Show handler file path.
B) Where do insights come from TODAY?
- DB table (insights) OR generated from events/sources.
- Show the generator/service file path.
C) Confirm whether any part returns mock arrays.
- Search code for: mock, sample, placeholder, fake, seed, TODO, hardcoded insight list.
- Report findings.

SECTION 5 — Launchpad → Draft → Amalgamated Editor
A) “Generate draft” button:
- Show client file path where it calls API.
- Show API endpoint used to create draft (and where draft is stored).
B) Navigation to editor:
- Show route shape (/ice/:id/edit etc) and the code that navigates there.
C) Editor load:
- Show how editor fetches draft by ID on refresh (must not rely only on in-memory state).
- Provide endpoint + handler.

SECTION 6 — Publish + Ice Views feedback
A) What happens when publishing?
- Endpoint + storage tables updated.
B) Where do “Ice Views” come from?
- Confirm it counts only published interactive experience views (as previously decided).
- Show the table/query used.

SECTION 7 — Smoke Test Script (must be doable in under 10 minutes)
Provide a step-by-step manual test with:
- exact URLs to visit
- actions to perform
- what DB rows should appear (which tables)
- what metrics should increase
- what insight should appear/change

FINAL OUTPUT
Return a table with rows for each section:
Claim | Traffic | Event storage | Metrics | Insights | Draft creation | Editor load | Publish | Views feedback
and columns: Status (REAL/STUB/MOCK), Evidence (file paths + tables), Next fix if not real.

Your own “no BS” manual smoke test (do this yourself)

This is how you personally verify it’s real, even if Raplet says it is.

1) Watch the network calls
	•	Open Launchpad
	•	Open DevTools → Network
	•	Click “Make Ice” → “Generate draft”
	•	Confirm:
	•	there’s a POST to create the draft
	•	response includes a real id
	•	editor then loads via GET using that id

If you don’t see the GET on refresh, it’s client-state-only.

2) Prove traffic is real

Open the public thing that receives traffic (published Ice view or Orbit page) in:
	•	Incognito window
	•	Mobile hotspot (different IP)

Then go back to Launchpad and refresh:
	•	Visits should move
	•	Ice Views should move (if that’s the page you opened)

If metrics don’t move, you’re either looking at mock data or missing event capture.

3) Prove insights are derived from something

After generating a few events, check:
	•	Does /api/orbit/:slug/insights response change at all?
	•	Do timestamps update?
	•	Does “source” reference anything real (sessions/events)?

If insights are always identical across orbits, it’s mock or template.

4) Prove Library is real storage
	•	Create a draft
	•	Refresh the whole app
	•	Go to Library
	•	Draft still there
	•	Click it → Editor loads same draft

If it disappears, it’s local-only.

⸻

What “mock data smell” looks like

When you’re inspecting responses or code, these are red flags:
	•	Arrays of insights with identical wording across different orbits
	•	Numbers that never change with real traffic
	•	Comments like // TODO, // stub, sampleInsights, mockMetrics
	•	Math.random() used for metrics or confidence
	•	“createdAt” always now, never older

⸻

If you run that audit prompt through Raplet and paste the table it returns, I’ll give you a blunt verdict: what’s truly connected, what’s cosmetic, and the shortest path to make the loop real end-to-end without overbuilding.
