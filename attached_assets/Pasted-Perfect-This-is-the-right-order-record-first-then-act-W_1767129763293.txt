Perfect. This is the right order: record first, then act.

What you want Replit to do right now is memory capture, not design, not implementation.

Below is a clean, authoritative instruction you can give Replit to record these two things properly in Replit.md.

You can paste this verbatim.

Instruction to Replit: Record New Confirmed Behaviours

Planning Mode – Documentation Update Required

Before any further work, record the following as confirmed system behaviour in Replit.md.

This is not a proposal. These behaviours are agreed and must be treated as canonical.

⸻

1. Interactivity Nodes Between Cards
	•	The system supports interactivity nodes that exist between cards, not on cards.
	•	These nodes represent conversational or interactive moments (pause, reflection, dialogue).
	•	Each interactivity node can invoke an AI character interaction.
	•	Interactivity nodes use the existing, production-tested AI runtime logic.
	•	There are no placeholders or mock interactions.

Preview behaviour:
	•	Interactivity nodes are fully live in preview.
	•	Users can speak to the AI character during preview.
	•	Preview interactions are session-limited and non-persistent.

Published behaviour:
	•	Interactivity nodes are available to the public.
	•	AI character interaction is persistent and requires a subscription.

Preview and Published modes share the same execution path.
Preview only limits access and persistence.

⸻

2. Shopping List / Production Manifest
	•	The system can calculate, at any moment:
	•	Number of cards
	•	Number of interactivity nodes
	•	Number of AI characters
	•	Media counts by type (images, video, music, voice)
	•	This information is presented to the user as a shopping list / production manifest, not as credits or tokens.
	•	Media generation is itemised by type (images, video, music, voice).
	•	AI character interaction is itemised separately from media.
	•	Users can:
	•	Toggle media types on or off
	•	See the price update in real time
	•	Users may download a non-interactive cinematic experience (rendered media only).
	•	AI interactivity is not downloadable and is only available in published experiences.

⸻

Confirm once this is fully documented in Replit.md.
Do not proceed with design or implementation until confirmation is given.

⸻

Why this works
	•	It clearly says “record this”, not “think about this”
	•	It anchors:
	•	Interactivity nodes
	•	Preview behaviour
	•	Shopping list pricing
	•	It prevents Replit from:
	•	Re-designing
	•	Simplifying
	•	Forgetting context again

Once Replit confirms this is written into Replit.md, you’re safe to move forward.

⸻

Next step (when you’re ready)

After Replit confirms, the only valid next actions are:
	•	UX surfacing
	•	Copy
	•	Guardrails

No new systems.

Say the word when Replit replies, and we’ll handle the next move with the same discipline.
