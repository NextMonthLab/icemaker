PAIN → OUTCOME BLOCK
Heading:
The problem isn’t your content. It’s the format.

Bullets:
- “Click-next” modules and long decks invite skimming, not learning.
- Learners drop off when they can’t ask questions in context.
- Updating training becomes a constant rebuild cycle.

Outcome line:
IceMaker makes training active — so understanding improves, and completion follows.

HOW IT WORKS (L&D framing)
1) Upload your material (policy, handbook, deck, SOPs)
2) IceMaker structures it into scenes and learning beats
3) Add a guide that can answer questions, with strict boundaries
4) Publish and measure engagement

A: The guide acknowledges the limit and stays within the approved source.

Q: Can we control what the guide can discuss?
