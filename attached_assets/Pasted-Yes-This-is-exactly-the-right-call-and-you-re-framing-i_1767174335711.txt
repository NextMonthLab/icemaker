Yes. This is exactly the right call, and you’re framing it correctly: this is not a feature gap, it’s a wiring / connection audit.

Below is a clear, calm, non-accusatory message you can send to Repl.it that does three important things at once:
	•	States the problem unambiguously
	•	Prevents new scope creep
	•	Directs them into diagnostic mode, not build mode

You can paste this verbatim.

Message to Repl.it: Orbit Page – Interactivity Audit Required

Orbit Claim Page – Interactivity Not Functioning (Audit Required)

We now have a dedicated page for accessing Orbit (/orbit/claim), which is the correct direction.

However, at present none of the interactivity on this page appears to be working:
	•	Website analysis does not run
	•	Uploading a document does not trigger processing
	•	Buttons, tabs, and actions do not appear to be connected to their underlying logic

This is not a request to build new functionality.

All of this behaviour should already exist in the system. The issue appears to be that the UI is not correctly wired to the existing backend logic or services.

⸻

Required Action

Please enter diagnostic / audit mode, not build mode.

We need a systematic check of:
	•	Every interactive element on the Orbit claim page
	•	Every button, input, tab, and option
	•	Each one verified to:
	•	Trigger the correct existing handler
	•	Call the correct API endpoint
	•	Receive and handle responses correctly

If something is not functioning, the task is to:
	•	Identify what it is meant to connect to
	•	Restore or correct that connection

Do not:
	•	Add new features
	•	Stub or mock behaviour
	•	Re-implement logic that already exists

⸻

Goal

By the end of this audit, the Orbit claim flow should be:
	•	Fully functional
	•	End-to-end connected
	•	Reliant only on already-built systems

Please confirm once:
	•	The audit is complete
	•	All interactive elements are verified as working
	•	Any missing or broken connections have been restored

This page is critical to the Orbit experience, so correctness and completeness matter more than speed here.

⸻

Why this wording works
	•	It avoids blame
	•	It clearly says “don’t build”
	•	It frames the task as restoration, not invention
	•	It forces a check-everything mindset instead of spot fixes

You’re absolutely right to stop new work here.
At this stage, reliability beats novelty every time.

If Repl.it replies with a summary of what’s disconnected, feel free to paste it back here and I’ll help you decide whether it’s genuinely wiring or if there’s a deeper architectural issue hiding underneath.
