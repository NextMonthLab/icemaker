Yep, your instinct is spot on, and the screenshots prove why this is happening.

What the UI is currently communicating (and why it breaks Marco)
	1.	You’ve got Add AI Chat on each card.
	2.	That opens Choose a character, but the only obvious option is “Experience Guide” plus “Create Custom Character”.
	3.	Separately, right at the bottom of the page, you’ve got Guest Cameo.

So the product is effectively saying:
	•	“Characters are for AI Chat” (modal)
	•	“Cameos are a separate thing” (bottom button)

That separation is fine in theory, but the naming overlap is causing the parser/ingestion logic to treat your brief character (Marco) like a “specialist style character”, and then it defaults back to a generic “Experience Guide” when it can’t reconcile the types.

You’re correct: Guest Cameo is too disconnected and too ambiguous.

⸻

The fix: make “Guest Cameo” a first-class option inside the character modal

Keep the bottom button if you want, but it should just be a shortcut that opens the same modal in the “Guest Cameo” state.

Updated modal structure

When you tap Add AI Chat on a card, the modal should clearly split:

Section 1: Main Guide (the normal AI character)
Title: Main Guide
Helper line: “This is your narrator and checkpoint voice. Pulled from your project brief unless you change it.”

Options inside:
	•	Chef Marco (From brief) (default)
	•	Edit pencil
	•	Create custom guide

Important: show “From brief” as a badge. That stops the system treating him like an optional specialist.

Section 2: Guest Cameo (video avatar)
Title: Guest Cameo (Video Avatar)
Helper line: “Short cutaway clips from experts, customers, or testimonials. Not your narrator.”

Then you choose cameo type:
	•	Customer testimonial
	•	Product expert
	•	Founder message
	•	Case study clip
	•	Other

When selected, it attaches to that specific card only.

This makes it impossible for the system to “replace the guide” accidentally, because the user has explicitly chosen a cameo.

⸻

Rename tweak (small but high impact)

“Experience Guide” is currently generic and invites the system to fallback to it.

Change the label to either:
	•	Main Guide
	•	Narrator
	•	Primary Guide

And only show “Experience Guide” as a fallback name if there is genuinely no brief character.

⸻

Behaviour rules (the guardrails that stop this ever happening again)

These should be coded and enforced, not left to prompting:
	1.	Brief Character always maps to Primary Guide
If the brief includes an AI character, that is primaryCharacter. Full stop.
	2.	Guest Cameos are opt-in only
Never auto-create them, never infer them.
	3.	A cameo can never replace the primary character
Cameos only attach to specific cards.
	4.	Default presenter for any AI Chat is the primary character
If no one is chosen, it uses Marco.

What to do with the bottom “Guest Cameo” button

You were right to spot it. It’s in the wrong place if you want clarity.

Best option:
	•	Keep it, but make it a shortcut that opens the same modal with the Guest Cameo section preselected.
	•	Add one line under it: “Attach a cameo to a specific card”.

Even better:
	•	Move it next to “Add AI Chat” as a small secondary action, so it’s clearly card-level.

⸻

Acceptance test (so you know it’s fixed)
	•	Create pizza ICE with Marco in brief
	•	Add AI Chat to card 2.3
	•	Modal shows Chef Marco (From brief) as default
	•	Generate ICE: Marco appears everywhere he should
	•	Add a Guest Cameo to card 2.4 only
	•	Generate ICE: cameo appears only on 2.4, Marco remains the guide

If “Experience Guide” appears when Marco exists, that’s a bug.
