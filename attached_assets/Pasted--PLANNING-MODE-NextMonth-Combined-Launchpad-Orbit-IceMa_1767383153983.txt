# PLANNING MODE — NextMonth Combined Launchpad (Orbit + IceMaker)

## Goal
Design a single, beautifully simple **Launchpad** screen that unifies **Orbit (insights + signal)** and **IceMaker (turn insight into content)**.

The user should feel: **“Insight in → content out”** with zero decision fatigue.
This launchpad becomes the default post-login destination.

## Context (Current System)
We already have:
- Orbit: Claim flow, Knowledge Map, Data Hub, Intelligence Views
- IceMaker: Create Experience, Projects, Templates, Professional ICE Editor
- Current Home is a switchboard with separate Orbit and IceMaker tiles

Problem: UI feels fragmented. We need a single hub where Orbit and IceMaker feel intrinsically linked.

## Core UX Loop
Listen (Orbit) → Distil (Insights) → Publish (Ice) → Learn (Orbit again)

## Launchpad Requirements (Desktop)
Create a single page with:
1) **Top Bar**
- Orbit selector dropdown (e.g. “KFC Co UK”)
- Status pill: “Basic scan” vs “Powered up”
- Primary CTA: “Create Ice”
- Secondary CTA (conditional): “Power up Orbit” (only when not fully configured)
- Link: Library

2) **Two-column workspace**
LEFT: **Orbit Signal + Insights**
- Small row of 3–4 metric tiles: Visits, Conversations, Ice Views, Leads
- “Today’s top insight” hero card:
  - title, 1–2 line meaning, confidence badge, tags (segment/topic), “Make Ice” button
- Scrollable “Insights feed” list:
  - compact cards with title, tags, confidence, timestamp/source, “Make Ice” button

RIGHT: **Ice Builder panel**
- States:
  A) Empty: “Select an insight to turn into content”
  B) Insight selected: show selected insight (2 lines max) + controls:
     - Format chooser (max 4): Hook+bullets, Myth vs reality, Checklist, Problem→Solution→Proof
     - Tone selector: Direct / Warm / Playful / Premium
     - Output toggle: Video card (download) / Interactive experience (publish)
     - CTA selector (optional)
     - Primary button: “Generate draft”
  C) Draft ready: show mini preview + actions:
     - Edit captions
     - Download video
     - Publish interactive
     - Trace link: “Made from: [Insight]”

3) **Bottom strip: Recent**
- recent drafts and published items
- each item shows trace: “Made from [Insight]”

## Launchpad Requirements (Mobile)
Mobile should keep the same mental model, but stacked:
- Top bar stays (Orbit selector + status + Create Ice)
- Tabs or segmented control for the main body:
  - Tab 1: Insights
  - Tab 2: Builder
  - Tab 3: Recent (optional)
Flow:
- Tap insight → persistent “Build from this insight” drawer/button appears
- Builder panel becomes a full-screen sheet with the same controls

## “Power-Up” Onboarding (Orbit Claim Stage 2)
After claiming an Orbit, show guided onboarding to increase Orbit strength:
- Ask for:
  - About page URL
  - Services page URL(s)
  - Team page URL (optional)
  - 5 or 10 key blog posts (allow “auto-select”)
  - Social channels (LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
- Show “Orbit Strength” progress indicator
- Completion moment: “Your Orbit is ready” with Before/After and button “Go to Launchpad”

## Design Direction
- Plain black background (no galaxy texture)
- Subtle coloured gradients for buttons/outlines (purple/magenta accents)
- Minimal, premium, spacious
- Avoid big blocks of purple background. Use accents, borders, and small highlights.

## Output Needed
1) A clear **desktop wireframe layout** (components, hierarchy)
2) A clear **mobile wireframe layout** (stacking + tab/sheet behaviour)
3) A short list of **existing screens to demote** (Orbit dashboard, IceMaker dashboard, current Home) and what they become (Library, Orbits admin, etc.)
4) Recommended route + nav label (e.g. /launchpad or /studio) and default post-login routing rules.

Do NOT propose rebuilding the whole app. This should be a re-ranking + a new hub page.
