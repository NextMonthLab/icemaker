RATPLID PROMPT: Update /for-businesses page to unify proposition (SmartSite Preview + ICE) and tighten conversion.

Context
- This page currently feels like two different pages stitched together: "Smart Site Preview" lead-gen plus "ICE" brand storytelling platform pitch.
- Goal: Make it feel like ONE coherent business page with ONE primary action, and a clear secondary path.
- Keep existing preview generation logic and endpoints exactly as-is. We are changing layout + copy + CTA consistency, not backend behaviour.

Primary objective
- Increase "Create free preview" submissions by reducing confusion and tightening the flow.
- Present ICE as the secondary path with examples and use cases.

Hard requirements (must do)
1) HERO SECTION REBUILD (top of page)
- Replace the current top hero copy with a single unified hero that introduces both paths clearly.
- New hero content:
  - H1: "See what NextMonth does for businesses in 60 seconds"
  - Subhead: "Create a free preview showing how an AI assistant would answer customer questions about your business. Or explore how ICE turns your content into interactive story experiences."
  - Input placeholder: "https://yourdomain.co.uk"
  - Primary CTA button label: "Create free preview"
  - Secondary CTA button label: "Explore ICE examples"
  - Under the primary CTA add a trust line (small text):
    "We only use publicly available content. No signup. Nothing is published unless you choose."
  - Keep the existing preview form submission logic and validation, only update labels/layout.

2) CTA CONSISTENCY (entire page)
- Standardise CTAs across the whole page to only these:
  - Primary: "Create free preview"
  - Secondary: "Explore ICE examples"
- Remove or replace any other CTA labels like "Start Creating Free", "Get Started Free", "Or explore the full platform".
- Any bottom-of-page CTA section must use the same primary CTA label.

3) ADD "How it works" SECTION (immediately below hero)
Create a simple 3-step section focused on the preview flow:
- Title: "How the free preview works"
- Steps:
  1. "Paste your website"
  2. "We generate a preview assistant and demo answers"
  3. "Upgrade to publish, embed, and track leads"
Keep it concise and scannable.

4) ICE NAMING CLARITY
- On first mention of ICE anywhere on the page, use:
  "ICE (Interactive Content Experiences)"
- After first mention, you can refer to "ICE" normally.

5) USE CASES COPY TIGHTENING (keep same meaning, better outcomes)
Update the "How Businesses Use NextMonth" section to be outcome-led and consistent:
- Product Launch Stories: "Daily chapters that build anticipation and drive repeat visits"
- Customer Success Series: "Turn case studies into guided before and after journeys"
- Company Culture Content: "Employee spotlights that make your brand feel human"
Keep the section but tighten the intro paragraph so it does not repeat the hero.

6) SCENARIOS SECTION CLEANUP (Problem -> ICE Experience -> Outcome)
- Keep the scenario card layout but rewrite the internal labels and tense consistency.
For the "Innovative Manufacturer" scenario:
  - Problem: "Dense technical documentation, CAD specs, and engineering white papers overwhelm prospects and slow sales cycles."
  - ICE experience: "ICE turns product specs into an interactive experience where an AI engineer guide walks prospects through features, answers technical questions in real time, and demonstrates use cases visually."
  - Outcome: "Shorter sales cycles as prospects self-educate. Technical complexity becomes an advantage, not a barrier."
- Ensure consistent grammar: no random "Transforms" vs "They transform" mismatch.
- Make the three rows visually scannable with strong label hierarchy.

7) REMOVE UNVERIFIABLE CLAIMS + FIX TYPOS
- Fix: "Ready to Transform Your Businesse Content?" -> "Ready to transform your business content?"
- Replace "Join thousands of businesses..." with a safer line unless we have proof:
  Use: "Join businesses already creating story experiences with NextMonth."
Do not invent metrics like "thousands" or "5x" unless already supported by real data in the codebase/content.

8) SECONDARY CTA ANCHOR BEHAVIOUR
- "Explore ICE examples" should scroll to the ICE examples / scenarios section on the same page (anchor link).
- Keep it smooth and obvious.

Design and UX requirements
- Preserve mobile/tablet/desktop responsiveness.
- Improve hierarchy: hero headline, subhead, input + CTA row, trust line.
- Keep spacing clean and premium.
- Ensure buttons use consistent styling and states across the page.
- Avoid long dashes. Use normal hyphens if needed.

Acceptance criteria checklist
- Page reads as one coherent business proposition (preview first, ICE second).
- Only two CTA labels appear site-wide on this page: "Create free preview" and "Explore ICE examples".
- The preview form still works exactly the same as before.
- ICE is explained on first mention as "ICE (Interactive Content Experiences)".
- Typos removed, tense consistent, claims are credible.
- Secondary CTA scrolls to examples section.

Deliverable
- Commit the updated /for-businesses page changes with clean, readable component structure.
- If the page is currently hard-coded, refactor lightly into sections/components only if it improves clarity (no over-engineering).
