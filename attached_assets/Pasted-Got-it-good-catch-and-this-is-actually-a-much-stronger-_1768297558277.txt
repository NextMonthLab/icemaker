Got it — good catch, and this is actually a much stronger architectural decision. Using the exact same pipeline as users is the right call. It keeps demos honest and dogfoods the product properly.

Below is the corrected Raplet prompt, rewritten to make it explicit that:
	•	Demo ICEs are created via the standard IceMaker UI
	•	They are stored and treated as normal ICEs
	•	The difference is how they are surfaced, not how they’re built

This is still expectation-setting only. No build yet.

Raplet System Prompt – IceMaker Demo & Case Study Architecture (Revised: Non-Hardcoded)

Context

IceMaker will soon include a set of first-party demo ICEs used for:
	•	Product demonstration
	•	Sales enablement
	•	Onboarding inspiration

These demo ICEs are not hard-coded.

They are:
	•	Created using the standard IceMaker UI
	•	Generated through the same ingestion, card generation, media generation, and interaction pipeline as user ICEs
	•	Stored in the same underlying ICE system

The distinction is presentation and surfacing, not creation.

This prompt is not a build request.
It is an architectural signal so the project is prepared for what’s coming.

⸻

Core Principle (Important)

Demo ICEs must prove IceMaker by being made with IceMaker.

There must be:
	•	No special rendering path
	•	No special playback logic
	•	No “fake” or mocked experience

If a demo works, it works because IceMaker works.

⸻

Concept: Demo ICEs

Demo ICEs are:
	•	Created via the normal UI
	•	Generated from real prompts and source material
	•	Identical in structure to user ICEs

They differ only in:
	•	How they are flagged or categorised
	•	How they are surfaced in the UI

Examples of future identifiers (do not implement yet):
	•	isDemo: true
	•	visibility: demo
	•	category: case-study

Exact mechanism TBD.

⸻

Dedicated Demo / Case Study Page (Future Scaffold)

Raplet should expect a future dedicated page conceptually similar to:
	•	/demos
	•	/case-studies
	•	/examples

This page will:
	•	Query and list ICEs that are marked as demo ICEs
	•	Display them as cards or tiles
	•	Provide short contextual copy per demo:
	•	Sector
	•	Use case
	•	What problem it solves
	•	Include a single primary action per demo:
	•	“View demo”
	•	“Launch experience”

Important:
	•	The launch action opens the ICE using the standard ICE viewer
	•	No editing or duplication from this page
	•	This is a showcase, not a workspace

⸻

Homepage Awareness (Future)

The IceMaker homepage will later include:
	•	A small section introducing demo ICEs
	•	A short explanation like:
“See how IceMaker works in real scenarios”
	•	A CTA such as:
	•	“View demos”
	•	“Explore examples”

This CTA routes users to the dedicated demo page.

The homepage does not embed full demos.

⸻

Separation of Concerns

Raplet should conceptually separate:

User ICEs
	•	Created by users
	•	Listed in personal or team dashboards
	•	Editable, duplicable, exportable

Demo ICEs
	•	Created by the IceMaker team (via the same UI)
	•	Listed on a public-facing demo page
	•	View-only
	•	Used for inspiration, sales, and onboarding

Same data model.
Different surfacing.

⸻

Future-Proofing Notes (Do Not Build Yet)

Raplet should assume:
	•	Multiple demo ICEs across different sectors
	•	Demo ICEs may be updated, replaced, or retired
	•	Demo ICEs may later include:
	•	A “Use this as a starting point” flow
	•	A “Duplicate into my workspace” action (optional, future)

None of this is required now.
Just don’t block it.

⸻

Summary for Raplet
	•	Demo ICEs are real ICEs
	•	They are not hard-coded
	•	They are created through the standard IceMaker UI
	•	The system will later need:
	•	A demo listing page
	•	Homepage links to that page
	•	A clean way to surface demo ICEs separately from user ICEs

No implementation required yet.
Just be ready.

⸻

If you want, next step I can:
	•	Tighten this into a single “Raplet Expectation Block” you can keep pinned
	•	Or help you define the minimal metadata you’ll eventually need to flag demo ICEs cleanly without regret later

This is solid groundwork. You’re thinking like a platform owner, not a feature builder.
