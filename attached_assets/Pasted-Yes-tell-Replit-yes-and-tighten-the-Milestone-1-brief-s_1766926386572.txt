Yes – tell Replit yes, and tighten the Milestone 1 brief so it matches what you’ve already got working (your URL preview) without rebuilding the world.

Here’s the key: Milestone 1 is not “start Orbit from scratch”. It’s:

Formalise the existing preview into a versioned Orbit Pack, stored in object storage, and render Orbit from the pack.

That turns your current magic into an asset.

Copy-paste this back to Replit:

Replit: Yes, Build Plan for Milestone 1 (with one constraint)

Yes please. Create the build plan for Milestone 1: Orbit Pack Generator, but apply these constraints:

Ground truth

We already have a working URL ingestion preview (“ForBrands” page) that produces a great Orbit-style preview. We do not want to throw that away.

Milestone 1 should wrap and formalise what exists into a persistent, versioned Orbit Pack that becomes the source of truth for:
	•	Public Orbit view (read-only grid)
	•	Future Business Hub sidebar curation
	•	Future ICE Maker bridge
	•	Future pack-powered Q&A

Milestone 1 Goals
	1.	Orbit Pack v1 schema implemented (as you outlined: meta, brand, boxes, entities, faqs, visualBible, index).
	2.	Pack generation endpoint:
	•	Input: website URL (+ optional brand fields if available)
	•	Output: stored orbit-pack-v1.json in Replit object storage (S3 compatible)
	•	Version naming: include timestamp suffix
	3.	Public Orbit route:
	•	GET /orbit/:businessSlug
	•	Renders grid purely from the latest Orbit Pack
	•	Unclaimed preview state: NextMonth branding + CTA “Claim this Orbit”, interactions limited (view only)
	4.	Regeneration strategy:
	•	For MVP: synchronous if fast, otherwise queued with status (“Generating…”)
	•	Persist “last updated” timestamp and version

Non-goals for Milestone 1
	•	No social OAuth
	•	No team permissions
	•	No analytics dashboards
	•	No multi-source ingestion beyond URL
	•	No complex local LLM interactions (pack-only rendering)

Build Plan Output Requested

Please provide:
	1.	File-by-file implementation plan (frontend + backend)
	2.	Data models required (businessSlug mapping → pack key)
	3.	API routes (generate pack, fetch pack, fetch latest pack)
	4.	Object storage key conventions
	5.	Minimal UI spec for the public Orbit grid (and how limited interactions are enforced)

Also note: we will use cloud LLM to generate the pack, and “local” server-side model later. For now, Milestone 1 only needs the pack generator + renderer.

⸻

Two extra thoughts (worth enforcing while you’re here):
	•	Keep Orbit Pack generation deterministic-ish: constrain prompts to produce structured JSON, validate it, and fail loudly if schema mismatches.
	•	Make packs immutable: never overwrite; always create a new version. That gives you auditability and future “Orbit history” for free.

If you paste me Replit’s Milestone 1 build plan when it replies, I’ll sanity-check it, call out any scope creep, and turn it into a crisp “Prompt 0 / Prompt 1” set for implementation.
