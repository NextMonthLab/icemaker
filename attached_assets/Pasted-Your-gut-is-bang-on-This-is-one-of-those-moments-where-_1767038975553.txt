Your gut is bang on. This is one of those moments where conversion psychology matters more than engineering neatness.

Right now the flow you’re describing feels like asking someone to marry you before you’ve even bought them a drink.

What you’re proposing instead is exactly how high-performing, modern creative tools win.

⸻

The Correct Mental Model (and why login-first is killing momentum)

IceMaker is not a SaaS app first. It’s a moment of curiosity.

People arrive thinking:

“I wonder what this would look like…”

They are not thinking:

“I am ready to create an account and commit.”

A login wall at that moment doesn’t test intent, it tests patience. And patience is in short supply.

⸻

The Flow I’d Lock In (this is the right one)

1. Launch Interactive Builder

No login. No friction. No guilt.

They see:
	•	Paste a URL
	•	Upload a document (PDF, deck, article, etc.)

This immediately communicates:

“Just try it. We’ll do the work.”

That alone puts IceMaker in the same league as:
	•	Notion’s “Try it”
	•	Framer’s “Paste a link”
	•	Webflow’s “Start building”

⸻

2. Silent Extraction (you take the hit here, and it’s worth it)

Behind the scenes:
	•	Extract structure
	•	Identify narrative beats
	•	Generate Short Experience only (clearly labelled)

Important framing:

“This is a preview build.”

You are not giving the full thing away.
You are proving intelligence.

⸻

3. Scaffolding Reveal (this is the magic moment)

They land inside:
	•	A cinematic card-based experience
	•	Editable text
	•	Re-orderable cards
	•	A sense of: “Oh… this already gets me.”

This is the aha.

At this point, they are no longer evaluating IceMaker.
They are evaluating their own content through IceMaker.

That’s the flip you want.

⸻

4. Gentle, Tiered Friction (this is where login belongs)

Now you introduce capability boundaries, not hard stops:

Allowed without login:
	•	Edit card text
	•	Reorder cards
	•	Delete cards
	•	Rename the experience

Triggers login + upgrade messaging:
	•	Upload your own images or video
	•	Generate AI visuals
	•	Generate dialogue or narration
	•	Export / share / embed
	•	Upgrade to Medium or Long experience

Each trigger should say, calmly:

“Create a free account to continue”
“Upgrade to unlock longer experiences”

Now the user understands why they’re logging in.

⸻

Why this works (and why it’s the best intent test)

This flow separates three very different audiences cleanly:
	1.	The curious browser
	•	They play
	•	They leave
	•	Cost: small extraction hit
	•	Value: brand impression + word-of-mouth
	2.	The engaged creator
	•	They edit cards
	•	They feel ownership
	•	Login feels logical, not forced
	3.	The payer
	•	They want richer media
	•	They need AI generation
	•	They’ve already seen value

Login is no longer a barrier.
It’s a doorway they walk towards.

⸻

The Pricing Psychology (this is important)

By limiting length (Short vs Medium vs Long), you’re doing something very smart:
	•	You’re not charging for features
	•	You’re charging for depth of expression

That feels premium, not petty.

It aligns perfectly with:

“This is about storytelling, not buttons.”

⸻

One Crucial Detail (don’t miss this)

When the preview experience loads, add a subtle banner or badge:

Preview Experience
Short version · Generated automatically

This:
	•	Sets expectations
	•	Prevents “why can’t I do X?” frustration
	•	Makes upgrades feel additive, not corrective

⸻

If I were briefing Replit in one sentence

Remove the login wall from the entry point. Let users input a URL or document immediately, generate a short preview experience, allow basic card editing without authentication, and only require login when users attempt premium actions like media uploads, AI generation, exporting, or upgrading experience length.

That is a conversion-led architecture, not a tech-led one.

You’re not giving too much away.
You’re letting the product sell itself.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Map this to exact UI states
	•	Write the upgrade copy
	•	Or define the “Short / Medium / Long” boundaries properly so they feel inevitable rather than arbitrary
