Yes – this template is structurally strong and it includes the continuity blocks you asked for. But there are a few sharp edges in it that will either break imports or cause silent bugs later.

1) Biggest issue: primary_character_ids are not IDs

Your cards use:

"primary_character_ids": ["Elena"]

…but your characters[] don’t have an id field at all. So those aren’t “ids”, they’re names.

You need one of these patterns (pick one and standardise hard):

Best practice (recommended): add id to each character and only reference IDs

{
  "id": "elena",
  "name": "Elena",
  ...
}

Then cards use:

"primary_character_ids": ["elena", "marcus"]

Same for locations: you already have locations[].id, which is good.

If Replit implemented “match by name” behind the scenes, it’ll work for now, but it’s fragile (case sensitivity, duplicates, renamed characters).

⸻

2) You have two different character reference systems in each card

Each card currently includes all of these:
	•	primary_character_ids
	•	characters (array of names)
	•	location_id

That’s redundant, and redundancy becomes drift.

Recommendation: keep only
	•	primary_character_ids (IDs)
	•	location_id

Remove characters entirely unless it’s being used for something distinct (like “characters present” vs “characters chat-unlocked”).

If you need both concepts, make them explicit:
	•	present_character_ids: who is in the scene
	•	chat_unlocked_character_ids: who you can chat to from that card

3) The universe is labelled “Time Spent” but the story content is a different story

Your cards are clearly a relationship drama (Elena/Marcus/Sophie) in a cafe/park. That’s totally fine for a template, but calling it “Time Spent” will confuse everyone (including you in 2 weeks).

Do this instead:
	•	Template pack universe:
	•	"name": "Season Pack Template"
	•	"slug": "season-pack-template"
	•	Example pack universe:
	•	"name": "Time Spent (Example)"
	•	with actual Time Spent opening beats

You’ll avoid constant cross-contamination.

4) startDate is hard-coded to 2025-01-01

Not wrong, but it’s a footgun.

If your scheduler uses startDate to backfill “DayIndex → publish date”, this will dump a story into the past or force weird catch-up behaviour.

Safer approach:
	•	allow startDate to be optional
	•	if missing, set startDate at import-time to “today” (or “tomorrow”)
	•	or treat it as “season default” but override per card if publishAt exists

⸻

5) Your continuity fields are excellent – one tweak

You’ve got both:
	•	visual_style.base_prompt / negative_prompt
	•	visual_continuity.taboo_list

Make sure your prompt composer is doing this predictably:
	•	Final prompt = base_prompt + continuity + card prompt
	•	Final negative = negative_prompt + taboo_list + card negative

…and that taboo list gets mapped into negative properly (string join, no weird formatting).

⸻

The clean “gold standard” schema adjustments

If you want this template to be bulletproof, I’d change only this:
	1.	Add id to each character object
	2.	Make card references use IDs
	3.	Remove duplicate characters field in cards (or rename with purpose)

Example patch:

"characters": [
  { "id": "elena", "name": "Elena", ... },
  { "id": "marcus", "name": "Marcus", ... },
  { "id": "sophie", "name": "Sophie", ... }
],
"cards": [
  {
    "dayIndex": 1,
    ...
    "primary_character_ids": ["elena", "marcus"],
    "location_id": "coffee-shop"
  }
]


⸻

Bottom line
	•	Yes, this is the right kind of template (it includes universe + character + location continuity and per-card prompts).
	•	The only “must-fix” is the ID referencing, otherwise your linking will be brittle or broken.

If you want, I can generate:
	1.	a Season Pack Template ZIP using this exact schema but with neutral example content, and
	2.	a Time Spent Example ZIP with canon-faithful Day 1–5 beats (Mrs Thompson → walk → bag → first contact → the offer), using your continuity system correctly.
