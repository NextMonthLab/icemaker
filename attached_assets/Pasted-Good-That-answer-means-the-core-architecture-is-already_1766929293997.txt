Good. That answer means the core architecture is already where we want it: one route, immediate publish, preview = unclaimed public Orbit, same layout. That’s exactly the discipline we were aiming for.

Two things to do now:
	1.	We should delete or hard-deprecate /preview/:id ASAP (or 301 it), because “backward compatibility” becomes “two mental models” fast. If it must exist, it should always redirect to /orbit/:slug and never render its own UI.
	2.	On the claim security question: add magic-link verification now. Not later.

Here’s why I’m being blunt about that:
	•	Orbit is public and shareable.
	•	If claiming is unauthenticated, you invite squatting and embarrassment.
	•	This is not a “future polish” item. It’s basic product safety.

The right MVP claim security (simple, fast, good enough)

You don’t need DNS verification yet. Do this:

Magic-link claim flow
	•	In the unclaimed Orbit, CTA: Claim this Orbit
	•	User enters their email address
	•	System checks the business domain and compares:
Option A (best lightweight):
Extract business website domain from orbitMeta.sourceUrl and require the email domain to match (or be on an allowlist).
Example:
	•	sourceUrl = https://acmeplumbing.co.uk
	•	allowed emails: @acmeplumbing.co.uk
Provide an escape hatch:
	•	“My email domain doesn’t match” → manual review / support (later), or allow but flag as “unverified owner” and keep NextMonth branding until verified.

Send magic link
	•	Email contains a one-time token link:
	•	/orbit/:slug/claim?token=...

On success
	•	Set orbitMeta.ownerId
	•	Store ownerEmail, verifiedAt
	•	Orbit becomes “claimed”
	•	Sidebar unlocks for that user

What this protects you from immediately
	•	Random people claiming other businesses’ Orbits
	•	Sales reps generating an Orbit for a prospect then losing it to someone else
	•	Public share links being hijacked

What about non-matching email domains?

Make it explicit in MVP:
	•	If domain matches: instant claim
	•	If not: allow “request access” but keep it unclaimed until verified, or require manual approval.

If you try to handle every edge case now, you’ll slow down. But you must stop the obvious abuse.

What to reply to Replit (copy-paste)

Use this:

Replit: Great – implementation aligns with the checklist. Two actions:
	1.	Please hard-deprecate /preview/:id: it should 301/redirect to /orbit/:slug and not render its own UI to avoid dual mental models.
	2.	Yes, add claim security now (MVP): implement magic-link email verification. Ideally require email domain match against orbitMeta.sourceUrl domain for instant claim. If domain mismatch, route to a “request access” flow (can be manual/flagged for now). On verification, set orbitMeta.ownerId, ownerEmail, verifiedAt, unlock Business Hub sidebar.

Proceed with this before Milestone 2.

If you want, I can also give you the exact claim CTA copy for unclaimed Orbit so it feels premium rather than “signup wall”, but the key decision is made: magic link now.
