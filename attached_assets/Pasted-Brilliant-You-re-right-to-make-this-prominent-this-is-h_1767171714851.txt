Brilliant. You’re right to make this prominent – this is homepage, above-the-fold thinking, not a footer experiment.

Below is a clean, authoritative prompt you can give RepTilt. It tells them what to build, where to put it, and why, without drifting back into feature soup.

You can paste this verbatim.

Prompt to RepTilt: Homepage Value Framing (Time + Use Cases)

Homepage Update – Priority Section (Above the Fold / Early Scroll)

We need to add a prominent value-framing section to the homepage that clearly communicates:
	1.	How much time and cost NextMonth saves
	2.	What ICE experiences are used for, in plain language

This section should appear immediately after the hero (or integrated into the hero stack if space allows).

⸻

Part 1: Time–Cost Comparison (Simple Calculator)

Add a lightweight, single-screen comparison that answers:
“How long does this usually take – and how long with NextMonth?”

Requirements:
	•	Keep it intentionally simple (no complex forms)
	•	One selector or set of preset examples (e.g. Website page, Blog post, Case study, Training content, Campaign story)
	•	Use sensible defaults (no user input required to understand value)

Comparison should show three paths:
	•	Traditional production / agency
	•	Time: weeks
	•	Cost: thousands
	•	DIY tools
	•	Time: tens of hours
	•	Cost: multiple subscriptions
	•	NextMonth
	•	Time: minutes
	•	Cost: tens

Primary emphasis is TIME saved, with cost as secondary reinforcement.

This is not a financial calculator – it is a value mirror.

Copy should focus on:
	•	“Weeks → minutes”
	•	“30+ hours → under an hour”

⸻

Part 2: Clear ICE Use Cases (Immediate Self-Identification)

Directly below (or alongside) the comparison, add a clear section:

“What people use ICE experiences for”

Present 4 concise use cases, each with:
	•	A short title
	•	One sentence explaining the outcome (not features)

The four use cases are:
	1.	Marketing & Sales
(e.g. interactive landing pages, explainers, pitch experiences)
	2.	Content & Publishing
(e.g. turning articles, blogs, or scripts into interactive stories)
	3.	Training & Knowledge
(e.g. onboarding, education, internal explainers)
	4.	Creative & Storytelling
(e.g. narrative prototypes, interactive films, character-driven stories)

Do not list features.
Focus on situations and outcomes so visitors instantly think “this is for me”.

⸻

Tone & Intent
	•	This section should make the value of NextMonth obvious in under 10 seconds
	•	Avoid AI hype language
	•	Emphasise time compression, simplicity, and creative leverage
	•	This is a core positioning section, not a secondary explainer

⸻

Implement this as a first-class homepage section and confirm once placed and styled consistently with the existing brand.

⸻

Why this prompt works
	•	It anchors the why, not just the what
	•	It prevents RepTilt from over-engineering the calculator
	•	It keeps the homepage focused on value, not mechanics
	•	It reinforces your premium-but-accessible positioning

Once RepTilt comes back with a draft, the next step will be:
	•	tightening the copy for punch, and
	•	deciding whether the calculator itself becomes an ICE demo later.

But this is exactly the right move, at exactly the right time.
