RATPLID PROMPT: Tighten and unify the /for-creators page (Creators & Filmmakers) for clarity, conversion, and premium feel.

Context
- This is the /for-creators page aimed at filmmakers and creators.
- It already has strong raw copy, but it needs tightening for CTA consistency, scannability, and grammar/tone consistency.
- Goal: Make the page feel like one coherent proposition with a clear primary action, a clear secondary path, and a smooth narrative flow (script -> cards -> visual bible -> share).

Primary objective
- Increase clicks on the primary CTA: "Build a Story Experience"
- Reduce confusion by using consistent CTA labels and anchor behaviour.

Hard requirements (must do)

1) HERO CLEANUP (top of page)
- Keep the vibe, but tighten structure.
- Hero content must be:
  - Page label / eyebrow: "For Creators & Filmmakers"
  - H1: "Your story, one moment at a time"
  - Subhead: "Transform scripts and ideas into cinematic, interactive story experiences. Built for filmmakers who think in scenes, not pages."
- Replace the "Built for:" block with clean bullet tags or pills (no stray hyphens):
  - "Short films"
  - "Trailers and proof of concepts"
  - "Interactive fiction"
- CTA row must contain only:
  - Primary button: "Build a Story Experience"
  - Secondary button: "Browse examples"
- Remove or rename any other CTA labels in the hero (e.g. "See an example experience") so they match the two above.

2) CTA CONSISTENCY (entire page)
- Across the whole page, only these two CTA labels may appear:
  - Primary: "Build a Story Experience"
  - Secondary: "Browse examples"
- Replace "See an example experience" and "See an example experience / Browse examples" variants with the standard labels.
- The bottom-of-page CTA section must use the same labels.

3) ADD A SIMPLE "How it works" SECTION (directly after hero)
Insert a 4-step section that matches the promise and helps scanning:
- Title: "From script to experience"
- Steps:
  1. "Upload your script or outline"
  2. "We turn scenes into cinematic cards"
  3. "Lock your visual bible for consistency"
  4. "Share as a link or release in chapters"
Keep it tight. No long paragraphs.

4) "From script to screen" SECTION: tighten + make scannable
- Keep the existing subsections but convert them into a consistent pattern:
  - Heading
  - One sentence max
  - 3 short bullets max if needed
- Keep these features, but tighten the copy:
  - Scripts become story cards
  - Cinematic visuals per card
  - Optional character interaction
  - Release your way
- Ensure the output line is clean and consistent:
  - "Output: cinematic cards, optional character chat, shareable link"
- Avoid long dashes. Use normal hyphens or rewrite sentences.

5) ICE NAMING CLARITY (first mention only)
- The first time ICE appears anywhere on this page, write:
  "ICE (Interactive Content Experiences)"
- After that, ICE is fine on its own.

6) VISUAL BIBLE SYSTEM SECTION: improve clarity + examples
- Keep the concept, but tighten into:
  - Title: "Visual Bible System"
  - One short paragraph explaining: define look once, apply across every card, keeps continuity.
  - Then a compact list of example styles:
    - "Neo-noir"
    - "Warm naturalism"
    - "High contrast sci-fi"
    - "Handheld documentary"
- Add one short proof-style line beneath:
  "Characters stay recognisable. Locations feel connected. The look stays coherent from first scene to last."
(Keep "recognisable" spelling.)

7) PERFECT FOR SECTION: tighten and de-duplicate
- Keep list but make it compact and avoid repeating the hero.
Suggested list:
  - "Short films and micro-cinema"
  - "Trailers and teasers"
  - "Pilot episodes and proof of concepts"
  - "Experimental storytelling"
  - "Interactive fiction"
  - "Music video narratives"

8) CREATOR STORIES / SCENARIO CARD: fix tense + labels
- Current scenario reads inconsistently ("They use ICE to" then "Builds...").
- Standardise the scenario card structure to:
  - "Problem"
  - "How they use ICE"
  - "Outcome"
For "Independent Filmmaker", use this copy (or very close):
  - Problem: "A polished screenplay and a clear creative vision, but limited budget for full previs to pitch investors or align a team."
  - How they use ICE: "They build a living storyboard: AI-generated scenes that communicate shots, lighting, composition, and mood so cast and crew understand the vision before day one."
  - Outcome: "Investors grasp the vision faster. Crew arrives aligned. Production runs smoother and the budget holds."
- Keep it punchy. Avoid overpromising.

9) FINAL CTA SECTION: sharpen and match CTAs
- Title: "Ready to bring your story to life?"
- Subhead: "Build an interactive story experience your audience can explore, not just watch."
- Buttons:
  - Primary: "Build a Story Experience"
  - Secondary: "Browse examples"
- Secondary button should scroll to the examples / creator stories section (anchor link with smooth scroll).

Design and UX requirements
- Preserve responsive layout on mobile/tablet/desktop.
- Improve typography hierarchy: hero > sections > feature cards.
- Make sections more scannable: shorter lines, less repetition, consistent spacing.
- Keep premium feel: generous whitespace, consistent button styles.
- Avoid long dashes (—). Use standard hyphens or rewrite.

Acceptance criteria checklist
- Only two CTA labels exist across the page: "Build a Story Experience" and "Browse examples".
- Secondary CTA scrolls to examples section.
- ICE is clarified on first mention as "ICE (Interactive Content Experiences)".
- Scenario grammar/tenses are consistent and readable.
- Bullets/tags render cleanly (no stray hyphens).
- No new backend logic. This is copy/layout only.

Deliverable
- Commit changes to the /for-creators page component with clean section structure.
- If helpful, refactor into small presentational sections (Hero, HowItWorks, Features, VisualBible, Scenarios, FinalCTA) without over-engineering.
