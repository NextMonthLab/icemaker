Yes. Absolutely yes.
And not as a rambling update – this needs to be formally recorded as a locked product decision, otherwise drift will creep back in.

What you want here is a single source-of-truth record that future build decisions, prompts, and refactors must obey.

I’d do this in two layers:

⸻

1. A concise “Decision Record” (this is the important bit)

This should be treated as locked product doctrine, not discussion.

You can send this to Replit / RatPlan and also store it wherever you keep canonical decisions (repo docs, Notion, etc.).

📌 Decision Record: Orbit Claiming & Tier Model (LOCKED)

Decision summary
All businesses can and should claim their Orbit for free. Orbit is the universal home for every business. Capability is tiered, not access.

Locked principles
	1.	There is only one Orbit per business
	•	Public
	•	Lives at /orbit/:slug
	•	Always exists
	•	Always shareable
	2.	Claiming is universal and free
	•	Claiming does not imply payment
	•	Claiming establishes ownership and identity
	•	Claiming unlocks a free Data Hub (read-only)
	3.	Free (Claimed) Orbit includes
	•	Public Orbit view (NextMonth branded)
	•	Ownership of the Orbit
	•	Read-only Data Hub showing:
	•	Visit counts
	•	Interaction counts
	•	Conversation counts
	•	ICE views
	•	No access to:
	•	Conversation transcripts
	•	Insight summaries
	•	Intelligence analysis
	•	ICE Maker
	•	Intelligence curation
	•	Sidebar editing
	4.	Paid Orbit = Orbital Intelligence Viewer – Business Hub
Unlocks:
	•	Sidebar (curation layer)
	•	Intelligence expansion (add/prioritise boxes, connect sources)
	•	ICE Maker (express + polish)
	•	Insight access (themes, intent, questions)
	•	Reduced NextMonth branding
	5.	Preview is not a separate product
	•	“Preview” is simply an unclaimed or free claimed Orbit state
	•	Same route, same layout, same pack
	•	Differences are branding and capability gates only
	6.	Data philosophy
	•	Activity is free
	•	Understanding is paid

Status: LOCKED
Do not reinterpret without explicit decision update

⸻

2. A short instruction to Replit (execution-focused)

This keeps them aligned without re-debating intent.

Message to Replit (copy-paste)

We are locking a product decision:

All businesses can claim their Orbit for free. Orbit is the universal home for every business. Capability is tiered, not access.

Claiming unlocks ownership and a read-only Data Hub (activity counts only). Paid plans unlock the Business Hub sidebar, intelligence curation, ICE Maker, and insight access.

There is no separate preview product. Preview is just an Orbit state.

Please treat this as locked doctrine and ensure upcoming Milestones (Business Hub, Data Hub, ICE bridge) align with this model.

⸻

Why this is worth recording now (straight talk)

If you don’t record this:
	•	Someone will later “simplify” by making claim = paid again
	•	Or add a second preview surface
	•	Or hide data entirely from free users
	•	Or re-introduce CMS language

You’ve just made Orbit a home, not a funnel trick.
That’s a strategic move. It deserves a written record.

⸻

My recommendation

Yes, communicate this comprehensively once, clearly, and mark it LOCKED.

If you want, next I can:
	•	Help you design the free Data Hub UI so it feels valuable but incomplete
	•	Or write the upgrade copy that naturally flows from “you have activity” → “do you want understanding?”
