You’re right to trust that instinct.
What you’ve built technically is ahead of the language that’s introducing it.

Right now the copy is describing features.
What we discussed was a reframing of reality.

Let me be very clear and then very practical.

⸻

The core problem (in plain English)

Your current copy says:

“Here’s a clever AI thing you can try.”

What it needs to say is:

“Your website is broken by default.
This shows you the version that actually works.”

At the moment:
	•	“AI assistant”
	•	“cinematic story”
	•	“interactive experiences”

are all interesting, but none of them trigger necessity.

You don’t yet have the “LinkedIn company page moment”.

⸻

Why the current hero falls short

1. “See your website as an AI assistant in 60 seconds”

This is accurate, but weak.

A business owner doesn’t wake up thinking:
“I want an AI assistant version of my site.”

They wake up thinking:
	•	“My site doesn’t convert”
	•	“People don’t get what we do”
	•	“Leads are poor”
	•	“We’re invisible”

You’re describing the mechanism, not the pain.

⸻

2. “Cinematic story customers can explore”

This is good later, but wrong first.

“Cinematic story” sounds:
	•	Creative
	•	Marketing-led
	•	Optional

Whereas “Smart Site” sounds:
	•	Functional
	•	Inevitable
	•	Slightly scary to not have

You want inevitability, not inspiration, at the top.

⸻

The missing frame (this is the big one)

You are not previewing an AI assistant.

You are previewing the active version of their website.

That distinction changes everything.

⸻

How I would reframe the top of the page (concrete rewrite)

Section 1: Forecourt hook (this must be blunt)

Current

See your website as an AI assistant in 60 seconds

Replace with

Your website is passive.
See the version that actually talks to customers.

Sub-line:

Turn your existing website into a Smart Site in under 60 seconds.
No rebuild. No signup. Just see it working.

CTA:

Create my Smart Site preview

Support line:

Free preview. Ready in 60 seconds.

This instantly:
	•	Introduces a new category
	•	Makes their current site feel outdated
	•	Positions the preview as a reveal, not a demo

⸻

Section 2: Explain the preview properly (tight and honest)

Current

we’ll create a free preview showing how an AI assistant would answer customer questions

Replace with

We create a temporary Smart Site that sits on top of your existing website.
Customers can ask it questions.
It answers using your real content.
You see what your website would do if it could actually respond.

That’s the “forecourt walk-around”.

⸻

Section 3: Reposition “cinematic story” as the how, not the why

Move this down, not away.

Instead of:

Turn your website into a cinematic story customers can explore

Use:

How Smart Sites work

Then:

Smart Sites present your content as a guided, cinematic experience customers can explore or talk to.

Now it feels like:
	•	A method
	•	Not a creative indulgence

⸻

Fixing “How it works” (small but important tweaks)

Your structure is solid, but the language is still creator-led, not business-led.

Before

Enter a URL or upload documents
NextScene extracts the meaning

After

Connect your existing website
We understand what you do, how you sell, and what customers ask

⸻

Before

NextScene builds a visual story

After

Your Smart Site is generated
Your content becomes explorable, conversational, and clear

⸻

Before

“Talk to the brand” via AI chat

After

Customers can ask real questions
The Smart Site answers consistently, using your content

This subtly removes the “chatbot toy” vibe.

⸻

One line you should absolutely add (this is important)

Somewhere near the preview CTA:

Most websites answer nothing.
Smart Sites answer everything.

That’s a category line.

⸻

Big picture guidance (this is the takeaway)

You’ve already built:
	•	The right experience
	•	The right flow
	•	The right constraints

What’s missing is permission to feel necessary.

Right now the copy is polite.
This product is not polite. It’s disruptive.

You’re not offering:
	•	“A nicer website”
	•	“A creative AI layer”

You’re offering:

“The moment your website stops being a brochure.”

If you want, next we can:
	•	Rewrite the entire Business page end-to-end in one voice
	•	Or just fix the hero + preview section and test conversion
	•	Or A/B “AI assistant” vs “Smart Site” language explicitly

But your instinct is correct:
the words haven’t caught up with the product yet.
