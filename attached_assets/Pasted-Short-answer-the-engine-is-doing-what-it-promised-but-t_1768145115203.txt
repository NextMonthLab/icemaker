Short answer: the engine is doing what it promised, but the presentation contract isn’t finished yet. What you’re seeing now isn’t a logic failure – it’s a layout finishing issue. Totally normal at this stage, and very fixable.

Let me break this down plainly and then tell you exactly what to do next.

⸻

What’s actually happening (in plain English)

1. The hard problem is solved

Milestones 6 and 7 solved the hard, CapCut-level problems:
	•	Text never breaks mid-word
	•	Nothing overflows the box
	•	No ellipses
	•	Long captions scale down safely
	•	Editorial line decisions are deterministic

That’s the stuff most systems never get right. You’ve nailed that.

⸻

2. What’s wrong now is not the engine, it’s the box choreography

From your screenshots, two things stand out:

A. The text block is top-biased, not centred
You’re seeing “unused space” in the panel because:
	•	The text container is anchored from the top
	•	The engine fits width + height, but doesn’t vertically centre the result

CapCut always centres the caption block vertically inside the panel, even when the text is small.

Right now, your system is saying:

“The text fits, job done.”

CapCut says:

“The text fits — now centre it like a hero.”

⸻

B. Paragraph mode is doing its job, but it’s visually honest (maybe too honest)
Paragraph mode is correctly showing all the content.

But visually:
	•	Smaller font
	•	Tighter leading
	•	More lines

That makes the empty space feel more obvious unless the block is centred.

So again: layout polish, not engine failure.

⸻

Are the rules being broken?

No. And this is important.

Let’s check against the locked contract:

Rule	Status
Words never split	✅
No truncation	✅
All text inside box	✅
Aggressive shrink	✅
Max lines respected	✅

Nothing is violating Milestone 6 or 7.

What’s missing is Milestone 7.5 (not a new engine, just layout intent).

⸻

The missing piece: Vertical Composition

CapCut has an implicit rule you haven’t encoded yet:

The caption block is vertically centred inside the panel, not top-flowed.

Right now your structure is effectively:

Panel
 └─ Text block (natural height, top aligned)

What you want is:

Panel (flex)
 └─ Text block (centred vertically + horizontally)


⸻

The fix (conceptually, not code-dumpy)

You do not touch:
	•	fitTextToBox
	•	TitleComposer
	•	measurement logic
	•	scoring

You only change the rendering container.

Rendering intent should be:
	•	Panel = fixed size
	•	Inner caption wrapper = flex container
	•	Text block = centred both axes

In plain terms:

“Whatever size the text ends up being, centre it in the box like a title card.”

That alone will remove the “empty space at the bottom” feeling immediately.

⸻

One more subtle improvement (optional but very CapCut)

CapCut also applies a max readable width, even when the panel is wide.

That’s why captions feel chunky and balanced.

So add:
	•	A maxWidth on the text block (e.g. 85–90% of panel width)
	•	Centre that block horizontally

This prevents long paragraph lines from feeling stretched.

⸻

What I would do next (clear recommendation)

✅ Do this next (small, high-impact)

Call it Milestone 7.1 – Visual Composition
	1.	Vertically centre the caption block inside the panel
	2.	Horizontally centre the text block
	3.	Add a max readable width for paragraph mode

That’s it. No new engines. No new logic.

⸻

Reassurance (important)

You are not going in circles.
You are not failing to implement the research.
You are past the hardest part.

What you’re doing now is the same stage every pro motion tool hits:

“It works… now make it feel right.”

CapCut didn’t get this right in one pass either.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Define the exact “CapCut visual contract” (spacing, centring, max width)
	•	Lock it as Milestone 7.1
	•	Then move on to effects (typewriter, reveal, emphasis) without fear of regressions

You’re closer than it feels.
