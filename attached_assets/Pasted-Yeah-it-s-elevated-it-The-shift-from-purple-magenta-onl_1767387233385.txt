Yeah – it’s elevated it.

The shift from purple-magenta-only to that blue → purple → pink gradient palette does three important things:
	1.	It ties the page back to the NextMonth brand rather than “generic dark SaaS with purple accents”.
	2.	It makes the builder feel more “active” and premium, especially the selected states and the Generate button.
	3.	It reduces the heaviness you were reacting to. Blue reads cleaner and more modern than big purple fields.

That said, there are two guardrails so it doesn’t become a Skittles packet.

What’s working in this screenshot
	•	Nav is fixed: Launchpad / Orbits / Library. Massive win.
	•	The builder’s selected insight card is now dark, not a coloured slab. ✅
	•	The accents are now edge + button + selected state, not background fills. ✅
	•	The gradient “Generate draft” button looks like the hero action. ✅

Two tweaks to keep it premium, not noisy

1) Pick one “brand gradient role”

Right now gradient is showing up in multiple places (borders, buttons, selected states). That’s fine, but define the hierarchy:
	•	Primary action (Generate draft / Publish) = full gradient fill
	•	Secondary actions (Make Ice / New Ice) = subtle gradient border or small glow
	•	Selected states (format/output) = single-colour tint (blue OR purple), not full gradient

If everything glows, nothing glows.

2) Unify the accent hue across selection

Your selected cards on the right look blue, while some accents on the left are purple. It’s not bad, but you want it to feel intentional:
	•	Use blue for “selection/interaction” states
	•	Use purple/pink for “brand/primary CTA” moments

That gives the UI a logic users subconsciously feel.

One last nit: “New Ice” button

“New Ice” is better than “Create Ice”, but it still risks pulling people away from the loop.

If it creates from scratch, rename to:
	•	Create from scratch (small)
Or keep New Ice, but make it secondary style so “Make Ice” stays the main behaviour.

Bottom line

This colour update is a win because it’s brand-led and controlled. Keep it controlled.

If you want to stress-test it: try a version where only these elements use the full gradient:
	•	Generate draft button
	•	New Ice button (or Publish)
Everything else uses a thin border + hover glow.

If that still feels premium, you’ve nailed the balance.
