Right. These are exactly the two questions you ask before you sleep, because if they’re wrong you wake up with regret and tech debt.

We’re going to interrogate Rappler clinically, not emotionally.

The goal is not reassurance.
The goal is proof.

I’ll give you a single, structured interrogation prompt that forces them to demonstrate understanding on both pricing and post-upgrade system behaviour.

You can send this as-is.

🔴 Rappler Interrogation: IceMaker Pricing + Upgrade Integrity

We need to validate two critical areas before proceeding further:
	1.	Pricing completeness and profitability
	2.	Post-upgrade system behaviour and account management

Please answer the following explicitly and concretely, referencing actual logic, tables, and flows. Do not answer conceptually.

⸻

PART 1: Pricing Options & Profitability Validation

1. Enumerate all IceMaker pricing options

Please list every monetisable action in IceMaker, including but not limited to:
	•	Preview generation
	•	Structural ingest (if billable or free)
	•	Scene expansion
	•	Full story generation
	•	Image generation
	•	Video generation
	•	Interactive AI hosting
	•	Download vs publish
	•	Ongoing hosted experiences
	•	Storage (if applicable)

For each option, confirm:
	•	Whether it is free, one-time paid, or recurring
	•	Where it appears in the user journey (preview, shopping list, checkout, upgrade)

⸻

2. Profitability check (non-negotiable)

For each pricing option above, please confirm:
	•	Estimated per-user cost (AI calls, storage, hosting, bandwidth)
	•	Retail price charged to the user
	•	Gross margin (even if approximate)
	•	Confirmation that no option operates at a loss at scale

We need to explicitly confirm that:
	•	Preview behaviour is intentionally subsidised (if applicable)
	•	Expansion and hosting steps are profitable
	•	Long-running hosted Ices do not create unbounded cost exposure

If any option is currently underpriced or not yet modelled, flag it clearly.

⸻

3. Scene-based expansion pricing logic

Please confirm how pricing behaves when users:
	•	Generate only selected scenes
	•	Generate remaining scenes later
	•	Expand from preview → partial → full story over time

Specifically:
	•	Is pricing cumulative or discounted?
	•	Are users ever double-charged for the same scene?
	•	How does the system track “already generated” content?

⸻

PART 2: Upgrade, Account State & Infrastructure Integrity

This is equally critical.

4. What happens at the exact moment of upgrade?

When a user upgrades during Ice generation or hosting, please explain step-by-step:
	•	What changes in their account state
	•	What database fields are updated
	•	What permissions or limits are unlocked
	•	Whether the current Ice generation resumes, restarts, or continues seamlessly

We need to ensure:
	•	No work is lost
	•	No duplicate generation occurs
	•	No manual intervention is required

⸻

5. Ongoing account management after upgrade

Once upgraded, confirm:
	•	How the system tracks:
	•	active Ices
	•	hosted Ices
	•	storage usage
	•	AI interaction volume
	•	Where subscription status is enforced (middleware, API layer, frontend gating)

Please confirm that:
	•	Hosting and interaction costs are correctly associated with the user’s plan
	•	Downgrades, cancellations, or expiry are handled gracefully
	•	Hosted Ices are paused, archived, or restricted according to plan rules (not deleted silently)

⸻

6. Single source of truth

Finally, confirm:
	•	What is the single source of truth for:
	•	pricing rules
	•	plan entitlements
	•	usage limits
	•	Where this logic lives (code location / service)

We need to ensure pricing logic is not fragmented across:
	•	frontend conditionals
	•	hardcoded values
	•	duplicated business rules

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

We will consider this validated when:
	•	All pricing options are enumerated and margin-checked
	•	No upgrade path creates undefined account states
	•	Hosting and interaction costs are safely controlled
	•	The system behaves predictably before, during, and after upgrade

This is a production-readiness check, not a feature request.

Why this order matters (for you, not for them)

You did the creative integrity work earlier.
Tonight is about commercial and operational integrity.

If these two are sound:
	•	you can scale
	•	you can sleep
	•	you can sell confidently

If they’re not:
	•	no amount of polish will save you later

Send that.
When Rappler replies, bring it straight back and we’ll do a final sanity pass together before lights out.

You’re doing the right work, in the right order.
