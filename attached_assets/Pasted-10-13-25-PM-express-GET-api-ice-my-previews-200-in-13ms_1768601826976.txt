You made this. From flour and water. Take a moment – you should be proud.","sceneId":"stage_2"},{"id":"card_12","order":12,"title":"3.1","content":"Here’s the secret to great homemade pizza: a screaming hot oven. Crank yours up to maximum – usually around 250°C or 480°F. If you’ve got a pizza stone, put it in now. No stone? A heavy baking tray flipped upside down works great.

If you’ve got a pizza peel, great. If not, use a flat baking tray or the back of a chopping board dusted with flour. Slide the pizza off in one confident motion. Don’t hesitate – commit to it!

And I promise you – if you can stir and squish, you can do this. Let’s get everything ready. You’ll need: 500g strong bread flour, 325ml warm water (not hot – think baby bath temperature), 7g dried yeast, 10g salt, and a tablespoon of olive oil. That’s it. Simple ingredients, magic results.","sceneId":"stage_1"},{"id":"card_1","order":1,"title":"1.2","content":"First, let’s wake up the yeast. Pour your warm water into a bowl and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Now just leave it alone for about 5 minutes. You’ll see it start to foam and bubble – that’s the yeast coming to life. If nothing happens, your water was probably too hot or too cold. No stress, just try again with fresh yeast and water that feels warm but not hot on your wrist.","sceneId":"stage_1"},{"id":"card_2","order":2,"title":"1.3","content":"While the yeast does its thing, let’s prep the flour. Tip it onto your board and make a well in the middle – like a little volcano. Now here’s a tip: sprinkle your salt around the outer edge of the flour, away from where the yeast water will go. Salt and yeast aren’t best friends when they first meet, so we keep them apart until they’re mixed into the dough.","sceneId":"stage_1"},{"id":"card_3","order":3,"title":"1.4","content":"Your yeast should be lovely and foamy now. Pour it right into the well, add your olive oil, and grab a fork. Starting from the centre, begin mixing in small circles, gradually pulling in flour from the edges. It’s going to look messy and shaggy – that’s perfect. Don’t worry about getting it smooth yet, we just want everything roughly combined.","sceneId":"stage_1"},{"id":"card_4","order":4,"title":"1.5","content":"Now the fun part – kneading. Get your hands in there and bring it together into a rough ball. Then push it away from you with the heel of your hand, fold it back, turn it a quarter, and repeat. Do this for about 10 minutes. Yes, really – it’s a workout! You’ll feel the dough transform from sticky and rough to smooth and elastic. When you poke it and it springs back, you’re done.","sceneId":"stage_1"},{"id":"card_5","order":5,"title":"1.6","content":"Beautiful work. Now your dough needs to rest and rise. Rub a clean bowl with a little olive oil, pop your dough ball in, and cover it with a damp tea towel. Find a warm spot in your kitchen and leave it alone for 1-2 hours. You’re looking for it to double in size. This is a great time to clean up, prep your toppings, or put your feet up. You’ve earned it.","sceneId":"stage_1"},{"id":"card_6","order":6,"title":"2.1","content":"Right, let’s check on that dough. It should have doubled in size and look all puffy and pillowy. Give it a poke – if the indent stays and doesn’t spring right back, it’s ready. See those little bubbles on the surface? That’s all the air that’s going to give you a lovely light crust. Your patience has paid off.","sceneId":"stage_2"},{"id":"card_7","order":7,"title":"2.2","content":"Now we knock it back – don’t worry, it sounds more violent than it is. Just push your fist gently into the centre of the dough. You’ll hear and feel the air releasing. It’s oddly satisfying, isn’t it? This redistributes the yeast and gets the dough ready for shaping. Tip it out onto a floured surface.","sceneId":"stage_2"},{"id":"card_8","order":8,"title":"2.3","content":"Time to shape your base. Forget the rolling pin – we’re using our hands like proper pizzaiolos. Press down from the centre and push outward, rotating as you go. You’re aiming for about 12 inches across, with the edges slightly thicker than the middle. That thick edge becomes your crust. Don’t stress about making it perfectly round – rustic and delicious beats perfect and stressful every time.","sceneId":"stage_2"},{"id":"card_9","order":9,"title":"2.4","content":"Sauce time – and less is more here, trust me. Spoon about 3-4 tablespoons of passata or crushed tomatoes into the centre, then spread it outward with the back of the spoon in a spiral motion. Leave about an inch of bare dough around the edge. Too much sauce makes everything soggy. You want just enough to taste in every bite.","sceneId":"stage_2"},{"id":"card_10","order":10,"title":"2.5","content":"Now the cheese.

And I promise you – if you can stir and squish, you can do this. You’ll need: 500g strong bread flour, 325ml warm water, 7g dried yeast, 10g salt, and a tablespoon of olive oil. That’s it. Simple ingredients, magic results. Let’s go.                                                   |IMAGE: Bird’s eye view, beautiful mise en place arrangement on flour-dusted oak table – ceramic bowl of flour piled in centre, glass jug with warm water, small bowl of yeast granules, dish of coarse sea salt, olive oil bottle with cork stopper, ingredients arranged invitingly, warm golden-hour lighting from left catching flour dust, shallow depth of field, 4K photorealistic                                          |\r\n|1.2 |First, wake up your yeast in warm water – five minutes until it foams. Then pour it into a well of flour, add oil, and mix with a fork. It’ll look shaggy and messy – that’s perfect. Now the fun part: get your hands in and knead. Push, fold, turn. Ten minutes until it’s smooth and springs back when you poke it. You’ve just made pizza dough.                       |VIDEO (8s): Bird’s eye view, sequence showing foamy yeast in ceramic bowl, pouring into flour well, fork mixing shaggy dough, then hands entering frame from bottom – kneading rhythmically with push-fold-turn motion, dough transforming from rough to smooth and elastic, flour dust rising and catching warm golden light, satisfying ASMR quality, 4K cinematic                                                              |\r\n|1.3 |Now your dough needs to rest. Oil a bowl, pop it in, cover with a damp cloth, and leave it for an hour or two until it doubles in size. When it’s puffy and pillowy, push your fist in to knock it back – you’ll feel the air release. Then stretch it out with your hands, rotating as you go. Add your sauce, torn mozzarella, and pepperoni. Look at that. You made this.|VIDEO (10s): Bird’s eye view, time-lapse sequence – dough ball in oiled ceramic bowl slowly rising and doubling, fist punching down with satisfying deflation, hands stretching dough into round base on floured surface, spoon spreading red passata sauce, white mozzarella pieces scattered, red pepperoni circles arranged on top, final reveal of complete uncooked pizza, warm golden-hour lighting throughout, 4K cinematic|","stageContexts":[],"openingMessage":"Hi!
