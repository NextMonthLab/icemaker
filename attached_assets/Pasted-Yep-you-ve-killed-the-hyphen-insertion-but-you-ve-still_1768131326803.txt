Yep – you’ve killed the hyphen insertion, but you’ve still got “break anywhere” behaviour switched on somewhere, so the browser is now splitting words without hyphens:
	•	generati / ve
	•	astonish / ing

That doesn’t happen with normal wrapping. It happens when either:
	•	overflow-wrap: anywhere (most common)
	•	word-break: break-all
	•	line-break: anywhere
	•	(sometimes) text-wrap: balance combined with aggressive wrap rules

The fix: stop “anywhere” wrapping on the text element

In your resolveStyles() make the headline <p> (and supporting) explicitly use word wrapping, not character wrapping.

Use this exact combo:

const headlineStyle: React.CSSProperties = {
  ...headlineBase,

  whiteSpace: 'normal',

  // ✅ wraps at spaces, does NOT split normal words
  wordBreak: 'normal',
  overflowWrap: 'break-word',

  // ✅ no hyphenation
  hyphens: 'none',

  // ✅ make sure nothing is trying to be clever
  textWrap: 'initial' as any,   // safe no-op if unsupported
};

And do the same for supporting.

Important

If any parent/container has overflowWrap: 'anywhere', it can still influence the child depending on how you apply styles. So also make sure your panel/container styles do not include anywhere.

✅ Good container defaults:

const panelStyle: React.CSSProperties = {
  ...panelBase,
  whiteSpace: 'normal',
  wordBreak: 'normal',
  overflowWrap: 'normal',  // or omit
  hyphens: 'none',
};

What to search for (quick grep)

Search the project for any of these and remove/override them in the caption tree:
	•	overflowWrap: 'anywhere'
	•	wordBreak: 'break-all'
	•	lineBreak: 'anywhere'
	•	hyphens: 'auto'
	•	textWrap: 'balance' (or balance anywhere)

One of those is still active, guaranteed.

Why it’s choosing to split “generative”

Because your line clamp + font size is tight, and “anywhere” tells the browser:

“Feel free to break inside words to make it fit nicely.”

We want the opposite:

“Break at spaces. Only break a word if it’s so long it can’t fit at all.”

That’s exactly what overflow-wrap: break-word does.

Edge case: long URLs / hashtags

If you’re worried about super-long tokens, do this (optional but pro):
	•	keep the safe defaults above
	•	detect long words (e.g. > 18 chars) and only then set overflowWrap: 'anywhere'

But don’t turn “anywhere” on globally, or you’ll keep getting this CapCut-from-Temu vibe.

If you paste just the final resolved headlineStyle + panelStyle objects that resolveStyles() returns (literally the output values), I can tell you exactly which property is still forcing character-level breaks.
