You are Rapplet working inside the IceMaker codebase.

Goal
Build a new “Enterprise Custom Branding” information page and wire it into the app via strong, contextual CTAs (without adding it to the main navigation). This page must be discoverable from:
1) The Enterprise tier on the Pricing page (“Find out more” button)
2) Any relevant customisation areas inside the IceMaker UI (advanced caption settings, title/graph styling, media library, audio/music settings, etc.)

This page is a sales + education page, not a checkout.
Pricing is NOT fixed and must be framed as “tailored to requirements”.

Non-negotiables
- Do NOT add this page to the primary navigation menu.
- Do add clear, consistent “Find out more” / “Enterprise custom branding” CTAs in the right places.
- Keep it premium, minimal, and on-brand with IceMaker.
- The page must work in both light/dark themes (or the existing site theme).
- Use UK English spelling.
- Avoid long dashes (—). Use normal hyphens.

Route + Page
- Create a new route: `/enterprise/custom-branding`
- Page title: “Enterprise Custom Branding”
- Subtitle: “Turn IceMaker into your on-brand content factory for interactive experiences and video.”

Page structure (must implement)
1) Hero
- Heading: Enterprise Custom Branding
- Subheading: Consistent, brand-safe outputs across interactive experiences and video.
- Primary CTA button: “Talk to us about custom branding” (links to existing contact flow if present, otherwise a simple contact form on the page)
- Secondary CTA: “See what’s included” (scrolls down)

2) What this unlocks (explain the concept)
Short paragraph describing: IceMaker can be configured with a brand system so every export looks like the business created it in-house.

3) Feature blocks (cards or sections)
Include these as separate blocks with short descriptions and example bullets:

A) Custom Title Packs
- Fonts, colours, motion rules, lower-thirds, scene titles, intro/outro variants
- Designed to match brand guidelines
- Multiple layouts (top, middle, bottom) with correct spacing and sizing rules

B) Branded Captions and Data Styling
- Caption styles and animation aligned to the brand
- Graph/chart title styling and overlays
- Safe defaults for teams

C) Custom Music and Sonic Identity
- Approved music beds and mood packs
- Optional sonic logo / stings
- Consistent intro/outro audio

D) Custom Sound Effects Pack
- Brand-appropriate SFX library
- Optional “moment” effects for reveals, transitions, emphasis

E) Brand Asset Library
- Upload logos, imagery, icons, b-roll, templates
- IceMaker prefers approved assets over generic stock

F) Done-for-you Media Production (Enterprise Add-on)
- Filmed video intros/outros
- Presenter footage, interviews, b-roll
- Photography and campaign asset creation
Important: Frame as “available as a managed service” and “quoted separately”.

4) How it works (simple 3-step)
- Step 1: Discovery and brand guidelines
- Step 2: Build the Brand Pack (title packs, caption styles, audio, asset library)
- Step 3: Deploy into your IceMaker workspace with governance controls

5) Governance and approval
- Only admins can edit Brand Packs
- Versioning or change log if system supports it (if not, include UI copy that implies controlled updates)
- Optional: “approval workflow” as “available on request”

6) Call to action (bottom)
- Repeat CTA: “Request Enterprise custom branding”
- Include short note: “Enterprise customisation is tailored to your requirements. Final pricing depends on scope.”

Contact mechanism
- If there is already a contact page or contact flow, use it.
- If not, add a lightweight form on this page with:
  - Name
  - Company
  - Email
  - What you want to customise (checkboxes: Title packs, Captions, Music, SFX, Asset Library, Filming, Photography)
  - Notes
  - Submit should POST to an existing public endpoint if available. If no backend exists, stub the endpoint and store locally or log server-side with a TODO clearly marked.

Wiring requirements (add CTAs)
1) Pricing page
- In Enterprise plan card/section add:
  - Bullet: “Custom Brand Packs (titles, captions, music, assets)”
  - Button: “Find out more” -> `/enterprise/custom-branding`

2) Inside IceMaker UI: add “Custom branding” upsell entry points
Add small inline links/buttons in relevant areas:
- Advanced caption settings
- Title packs / title editor area
- Graph title / data styling area (wherever titles are configured)
- Audio/music settings
- Media library / assets uploader
Each should show:
- Label: “Enterprise custom branding available”
- Link: “Find out more” -> `/enterprise/custom-branding`

Implementation notes
- Reuse existing UI components (Button, Card, PageLayout) to keep style consistent.
- Keep copy tight and premium, no waffle.
- Ensure all new links work and do not break routing.
- Add basic analytics hooks if the codebase already supports them (track clicks on “Find out more” and “Request Enterprise custom branding”).

Deliverables
- New page at `/enterprise/custom-branding`
- Pricing page updated with Enterprise CTA
- Contextual “Custom branding” links added in the UI areas listed
- Any new components kept minimal and reusable
- No new top-level nav items
