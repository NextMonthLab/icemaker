Yep, I see the problem straight away. That page is doing “traditional website landing”, when Orbit should feel like an interface. If someone lands and sees a catalogue page, they’ll treat it like a brochure and bounce.

What you want is the right instinct: get people to the money immediately.

Here’s a clean, copy-paste set of instructions you can give Replit (RAPTOR/REPLAYER).

⸻

Replit brief: Kill the catalogue landing. Launch Orbit immediately.

The issue

The current /orbit/:slug page behaves like a traditional splash or catalogue page (vendors, products, stats, scroll content). It feels slow, conventional, and risks early drop-off.

Orbit should feel like the future of the internet. The first thing a user should experience is the Orbit UI itself.

New behaviour: “Instant Launch”

Desktop (laptop)
	•	When a user visits /orbit/smart-glasses, they should land straight into the Orbit experience.
	•	Keep a simple, premium header that is persistent:
	•	Title: “Smart Glasses” in Apple-quality typography
	•	Optional small hero image of smart glasses (subtle, not huge)
	•	Nothing else that looks like a marketing landing page
	•	The main screen should be the Orbit UI immediately (chat + map experience).
	•	If you want a “start point”, use a small overlay card, not a full page.

Mobile
	•	Remove the long scroll and catalogue sections completely.
	•	Instead show a micro splash overlay for 1 to 2 seconds max:
	•	“Smart Glasses”
	•	Subtitle: “The living map of the companies, products, and ideas shaping wearable computing.”
	•	Then automatically transition into the Orbit UI.
	•	Allow tap to skip instantly. No waiting.

UI content to remove
	•	Vendor lists
	•	Product lists
	•	“6 brands, 6 products” catalogue framing
	•	Anything that encourages scrolling before the Orbit experience starts

These can exist inside Orbit as views, not as a static page.

Why
	•	Orbit is an interactive interface, not a brochure
	•	Speed to value matters more than explaining what it is
	•	The map and chat are the hook, not a list of items

⸻

Implementation notes (so they build it cleanly)

Route behaviour
	•	/orbit/:slug should render the Orbit UI directly
	•	Optional: show an IntroOverlay component on first load only
	•	Desktop: either none, or a very small overlay that can be dismissed
	•	Mobile: auto dismiss after 1 to 2 seconds, skip on tap

Loading state

If Orbit data is still loading, show a calm, neutral loading state:
	•	Title + subtitle
	•	Small spinner
	•	No colourful blocks

Acceptance criteria
	1.	Visiting /orbit/smart-glasses reaches the Orbit UI immediately on desktop.
	2.	On mobile, the intro overlay lasts max 2 seconds and then transitions automatically.
	3.	No vendor or product catalogue sections appear on the landing route.
	4.	The header is persistent and minimal, with premium typography and optional small hero image.
	5.	Users can skip the intro instantly.

⸻

Optional improvement that fits your “future internet” goal

Instead of two big buttons (“Ask” vs “Explore”), default to a single primary mode:
	•	Launch straight into chat, with the map already present behind or alongside it.
	•	The map becomes a visual context layer, not a separate destination.

If you want, I’ll write you a one paragraph “why we are doing this” rationale in board-facing language, because this is one of those decisions that sounds subjective until you frame it as reducing friction and increasing time-to-value.
