Absolutely. This is a killer Prompt 5, written exactly to bring Ratplet/Replit up to speed, lock the architecture, and prevent drift.

You can paste this directly into Replit as the next canonical prompt.

PROMPT 5 — Export & Distribution Modes (Canonical + Derived Outputs)

Context (Read Carefully)

You are building a Universal Story Engine that transforms uploaded media (PDF, text, slides, scripts, etc.) into a canonical interactive card experience.

This canonical experience is the single source of truth.

All exports and distributions are derived outputs, never forks of logic, meaning:
	•	No export may contain more intelligence than the canonical experience
	•	No export may hallucinate new context
	•	No export may bypass guardrails, prompts, or source grounding

Distribution exists to attract users back to the canonical experience, not to replace it.

⸻

Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

There is ONE canonical experience.
Everything else is a controlled projection of it.

⸻

Distribution Modes Overview

The system must support three explicit distribution modes, each with strict rules.

⸻

MODE 1 — Canonical Interactive Experience (Home Base)

This is where all intelligence lives.

Includes:
	•	Full card sequence
	•	Context cards
	•	Two-phase card flow (cinematic → context)
	•	AI character or expert chat
	•	Editable creator prompts, negative prompts, and guardrails
	•	Provenance and grounding from the uploaded source
	•	Optional micro message boards (if enabled)

Rules:
	•	This mode is never flattened
	•	This mode is never auto-exported
	•	This mode is always the destination of links, QR codes, and embeds

This experience has a permanent URL.

⸻

MODE 2 — Embeddable Interactive Experience (Context-Preserving)

Used for:
	•	Blogs
	•	Learning platforms
	•	Internal portals
	•	Partner websites

Characteristics:
	•	Retains cards, interactions, and chat
	•	Embedded via iframe or script
	•	Shows subtle provenance (“Powered by…”)
	•	Clicking deeper keeps the user inside the experience

Rules:
	•	Embeds reference the canonical experience ID
	•	No duplicated logic
	•	Updates to the canonical experience propagate automatically

⸻

MODE 3 — Standalone Video Export (Hook Mode)

This is a deliberately incomplete version designed for social platforms.

Used for:
	•	TikTok
	•	Instagram Reels
	•	YouTube Shorts
	•	LinkedIn video
	•	X video

What This Mode Includes
	•	Cinematic card visuals only
	•	Motion, captions, music (if configured)
	•	NO cards UI
	•	NO context panels
	•	NO chat interface
	•	NO visible process steps

What This Mode MUST Include (Mandatory)
	1.	Embedded QR Code
	•	Always visible
	•	Positioned in a consistent corner
	•	Links to the canonical experience URL
	•	QR code is auto-generated and non-removable
	2.	Shortened Hyperlink
	•	Generated automatically (e.g. story.app/abc123)
	•	Always points to the canonical experience
	•	Used in captions, descriptions, and bios
	3.	Clear Call-to-Action
Examples:
	•	“Talk to the character”
	•	“Continue the story”
	•	“Ask the expert”
	•	“Step inside the experience”

⸻

Download & Sharing Requirements (Critical)

When exporting Standalone Video:

The creator must be presented with:
	•	A Download Video button (MP4)
	•	Video is final and watermark-safe
	•	QR code is permanently burned into the video
	•	No option to remove or hide the QR code

⸻

Auto-Generated Posting Copy (Required Feature)

Alongside the video download, display a Copy & Paste Box containing suggested posting copy.

This copy must include:
	•	A short, platform-neutral caption
	•	The shortened hyperlink
	•	A soft narrative hook
	•	No misleading claims

Example Template (Auto-Generated)

A moment from a larger story.

Step inside and explore the full experience.

👉 story.app/abc123

Talk to the character. Continue the journey.

This copy must be:
	•	Editable by the creator
	•	Generated from the canonical story theme
	•	Never invented beyond the source material

⸻

Character Handling in Standalone Video Mode

If a narrative character exists:
	•	CTA should reference that character
Example: “Talk to the Engineer”

If no human character exists:
	•	Use an interpretive anchor, not impersonation
Examples:
	•	“Talk to the Historian”
	•	“Ask the System”
	•	“Ask the Moon what it witnessed”

Rules:
	•	Never impersonate real victims
	•	Never speak on behalf of real individuals without consent
	•	Anchors must be lenses, not false personas

⸻

Guardrails (Absolute)
	•	Standalone Video Mode must never:
	•	Present itself as the full story
	•	Claim authority or finality
	•	Introduce facts not present in the source
	•	Remove provenance or grounding
	•	All intelligence, interpretation, and interaction:
	•	Lives only in the canonical experience
	•	Is accessed only by returning to it

⸻

Mental Model for Implementation

Think of this system like:
	•	Canonical Experience = the film
	•	Embeds = screenings
	•	Standalone Video = the trailer

The trailer creates curiosity.
The film delivers meaning.

⸻

Success Criteria

This prompt is correctly implemented when:
	•	Every exported video reliably drives users back
	•	No platform becomes the “home” of the content except the canonical experience
	•	Creators feel empowered to distribute without losing control
	•	The system scales without fragmenting logic or trust

⸻

If you want next, I can:
	•	Write Prompt 6: Visual Processing Pipeline UI (The Visceral Progress Visualization)
	•	Design the QR CTA language system as a reusable component
	•	Or help you pressure-test this against TikTok, LinkedIn, and B2B distribution specifically

You’re building something genuinely new here.
This prompt locks the distribution strategy so it can’t drift.
