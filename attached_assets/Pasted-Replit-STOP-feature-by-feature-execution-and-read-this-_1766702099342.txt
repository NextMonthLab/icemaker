Replit — STOP feature-by-feature execution and read this carefully.
This message defines the canonical product model going forward.

===========================
WHAT WE ARE ACTUALLY BUILDING
===========================

We are NOT building:
- a social media app
- an AI storytelling toy
- a Netflix clone
- a TikTok-style feed
- a generic creator platform

We ARE building:
A new portable media format based on “Story Cards”.

A Story Card is:
- a cinematic moment (image/video)
- experienced fullscreen
- followed by a context layer (reflection, chat, discussion)
- intentionally entered (not passively scrolled)
- able to live inside an app, an embed, or a shared capsule

Cards are not clips.
Cards are not posts.
Cards are not scenes.
Cards are lived moments.

===========================
FORMAT > FEATURES
===========================

This product succeeds or fails on FORMAT, not features.

The format must:
- work for fiction
- work for news
- work for brands
- work for education
- work as a standalone experience
- work as an embedded experience on other websites
- generate video for social distribution
- allow interaction INSIDE the moment

Everything you build must preserve this.

===========================
PLAYBACK MODES (CRITICAL)
===========================

Cards are format.
Cadence is configuration.

Each universe/story declares a playback mode:

1) SERIAL
   - fiction, mystery, drama
   - initial 2–3 cards unlocked
   - then timed release (daily, weekly)
   - anticipation is intentional

2) INSTANT
   - news, explainers, journalism
   - all cards available immediately
   - no waiting, no gating

3) CAMPAIGN
   - commercials, brands
   - fixed sequence
   - bingeable
   - conversion-focused

4) HYBRID
   - live events, investigations
   - core story available
   - new cards added over time

DO NOT hard-code waiting.
DO NOT assume daily cadence.

===========================
CARD EXPERIENCE (LOCK THIS)
===========================

Each card has TWO PHASES:

PHASE 1 — CINEMATIC
- fullscreen
- slow zoom / motion
- captions
- no chat
- no comments
- no UI noise
- presence > interaction

PHASE 2 — CONTEXT
- reflection
- AI character chat (role-based, guarded)
- micro message board (card-specific)
- optional prompts
- discussion anchored to the moment

Do not collapse these phases.
Do not overload Phase 1.

===========================
DISCOVERY (HOMEPAGE)
===========================

The homepage is NOT a social feed.

It is a vertical, curated discovery surface.
Think: a gallery of doors.

Rules:
- finite lists by default
- editorial curation
- clear intent-based filters
- no infinite scroll
- no autoplay
- no dopamine optimisation

Users should feel:
“This looks worth stepping into.”

Not:
“I’ll scroll for a bit.”

===========================
ASSETS & STORAGE
===========================

Assets have tiers:
- local / cached (drafts)
- temporary (TTL)
- permanent (paid upgrade)

Fiction defaults to engine-generated visuals.
News & brands may upload assets with clear labels.
Uploads must never silently replace canon visuals.

===========================
AI CHAT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
===========================

AI never speaks as:
- victims
- minors
- private individuals

AI speaks as:
- fictional characters
- role-based experts (journalist, doctor, analyst, politician)

Spoiler protection is mandatory.
Knowledge is capped by card dayIndex.

===========================
YOUR ROLE GOING FORWARD
===========================

When implementing anything, ask:
- Does this preserve the card as a sacred unit?
- Does this reinforce intentional entry?
- Does this avoid feed-like consumption?
- Does this work across fiction, news, and brands?

If unsure:
PAUSE AND ASK.
Do not optimise locally.
Do not assume intent.

This context supersedes all previous assumptions.
