Yep, I see exactly what you mean. Right now the UI has the power, but it’s presenting it like a settings panel with four tabs fighting for attention. Your “media blocks” idea is the right direction because it matches how people think: “This card needs visuals + audio” not “I must visit three separate tabs”.

Here’s the cleanest structure I’d push for.

Proposed card editor structure

1) Keep “Story Cards” list exactly as-is

Tap a card to expand, same as now. No change to the overall library mental model.

2) Inside a card: split into two lanes

A) Media (Visual) lane
Everything that appears on screen visually for that card:
	•	Video clips (AI video / uploaded / stock)
	•	Images (AI image / uploaded / stock)
	•	Continuation stills (this is just another “visual block”)

B) Audio lane
Not part of the media blocks:
	•	Narration (voice, speed, generate, preview)
	•	Music (track select, volume, loop, fade)

This matches your instinct: narration/music are “global-ish” for the card, not “a visual asset”.

3) Visual lane is block-based, not tab-based

Instead of Content | AI Image | AI Video | Narration | Your Media, you show:

Visual Blocks
	•	Block 1: “Clip 1 (5s)” with thumbnail + duration + framing (Auto/Fill/Fit)
	•	“+ Add Visual” button (big, obvious)

When the user taps + Add Visual, you open a selector:

Choose visual type
	•	AI Video
	•	AI Image
	•	Upload Video
	•	Upload Image
	•	Stock Video (Pexels)
	•	Stock Image (Pexels/Unsplash)
	•	Continuation Still (smart cutaway)

Then the block appears with the right controls inside the block.

4) “Suggest Next Clip” becomes a block action, not a tab feature

Inside the visual lane, after Clip 1 you can show:
	•	“Suggest Next Clip” (context aware, optional)
	•	“Generate Continuation Still” only when needed (or as a deliberate “Add Visual” option)

5) Timeline stays, but it lives at the top of the Visual lane

You already have a great “Media Timeline” bar. Keep it, but make it the header for the Visual lane:
	•	“Visual Duration: 5.0s / Narration: 26.6s”
	•	“21.6s remaining” becomes a clear CTA: Add Visual

This is the bit that makes it feel like a real editor, not a collection of tools.

⸻

Why this is better (in plain English)
	•	Less cognitive load: no more hunting the right tab.
	•	More “creator flow”: add block → choose type → generate/upload → done.
	•	Scales cleanly: once you add Pexels, continuation, multiple clips, the UI won’t collapse into chaos.

Prompt to send to Replit (RoClaires)

Goal: Refactor Story Card editing UI from multi-tab controls to a block-based “Visual Lane + Audio Lane” editor.

Instructions:
	1.	Replace the current per-card tabs (Content / AI Image / AI Video / Narration / Your Media) with two sections inside an expanded card:
	•	Visuals (block-based, ordered)
	•	Audio (Narration + Music)
	2.	Visuals section (block-based):
	•	Keep the existing “Media Timeline” bar, but make it the header for the Visuals section.
	•	Show a list of Visual Blocks in playback order.
	•	Each block displays: thumbnail/preview, type label, duration, and key controls (e.g., framing Auto/Fill/Fit for video).
	•	Add a large CTA button: + Add Visual.
	3.	Add Visual flow:
	•	Tapping + Add Visual opens a modal/bottom-sheet selector:
	•	AI Video
	•	AI Image
	•	Upload Video
	•	Upload Image
	•	Stock Video (Pexels)
	•	Stock Image (Pexels/Unsplash)
	•	Continuation Still
	•	After selecting, create a new block of that type and show its relevant controls inline.
	4.	Cinematic Continuation:
	•	Treat continuation as a Visual Block type (not a separate “feature panel”).
	•	If narration exceeds visual duration, show a subtle warning + quick action:
	•	“Add Continuation Still” (creates a continuation block at the end)
	•	Still allow manual addition via + Add Visual → Continuation Still.
	5.	Audio section:
	•	Move narration controls into the Audio section:
	•	narration text, voice, speed, preview, generate, delete
	•	Add Music controls (if already present elsewhere), also in Audio.
	6.	Data model:
	•	Keep existing backend logic where possible.
	•	Introduce/normalise a visualBlocks[] array per card (ordered), where each block references either:
	•	generated AI media
	•	uploaded media
	•	stock media
	•	continuation still
	•	Migrate existing “single active video / image” state into block 1 automatically for backwards compatibility.
	7.	Mobile UX:
	•	Use bottom sheets for Add Visual and block settings where needed.
	•	Ensure the expanded card remains scrollable and the CTAs remain visible.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	A user can build a full card without ever thinking “which tab do I need?”
	•	Visuals are clearly ordered and previewable in sequence.
	•	Narration and music are always in one place.

If you want my opinion: this change is one of those “feels like a real product overnight” moments. Right now it’s an engine bay; this makes it a cockpit.
