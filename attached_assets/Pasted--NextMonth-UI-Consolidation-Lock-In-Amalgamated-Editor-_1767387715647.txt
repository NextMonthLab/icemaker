# NextMonth UI Consolidation — Lock In Amalgamated Editor (CRITICAL)

## Objective
We are consolidating Orbit + IceMaker into a single, simple product flow:
**Insights in → Content out.**
This must feel like one system, not separate apps.

## The Rule (Non-Negotiable)
✅ **All draft creation flows must open the NEW Amalgamated Editor.**
❌ Do not route users into any legacy editor or legacy IceMaker dashboard UX.

The Launchpad “Builder Panel” is a launcher only (selection + configuration).  
The **Amalgamated Editor** is where editing, media, interactions, and publish/download happen.

---

## Navigation (Final)
Top-level nav must be:
- **Launchpad**
- **Orbits**
- **Library**

Remove or demote “IceMaker” as a top-level destination.  
Legacy routes may exist for backwards compatibility but should redirect into Launchpad/Library where appropriate.

---

## Core Pages & Responsibilities

### 1) Launchpad (default post-login)
Purpose: Unified hub that shows Orbit signal + insights and allows creating an Ice from an insight.

Key behaviour:
- Clicking **Make Ice** on any insight populates the right-hand builder panel.
- Clicking **Generate draft** must:
  1) Create an IceDraft record (or draft payload)
  2) Immediately open the **Amalgamated Editor** with that draft loaded

Launchpad is NOT an editor.

### 2) Library
Purpose: Content store for the user’s work
- Lists: Drafts + Published
- Clicking any Draft opens the **Amalgamated Editor**
- Published items open the viewer (with Edit if allowed)

### 3) Orbits
Purpose: Orbit configuration/admin
- Claim
- Power-up wizard
- Knowledge Map / Intelligence views
No Ice creation UI lives here.

---

## “New Ice” Entry Point (Source-led creation)
IceMaker currently supports creation from:
- Insights (primary)
- URL
- Paste text
- Upload

We still support these, but the entry point is unified:

### “New Ice” Button
Appears in Launchpad and Library.
Opens a small modal chooser with:
1) **From Insight (recommended)** → returns to/ focuses insight selection on Launchpad
2) From URL
3) Paste text
4) Upload file

After selecting a source:
- User configures format/tone/output
- Clicks **Generate draft**
- Must open **Amalgamated Editor** every time

---

## Editor Routing (Single destination)
Define a single canonical editor route:
- e.g. `/ice/:id/edit` OR `/editor/:id`

All “Generate draft” and “Open draft” actions must navigate there.

---

## Editor UX Requirement: Traceability
Inside the Amalgamated Editor, show an “Origin” chip:
- “Made from: [Insight title]” OR “Made from: URL / Upload / Paste”
This maintains the loop and prevents feature fragmentation.

---

## Implementation Guardrails
- Do not create a new “IceMaker Dashboard” page.
- Do not duplicate editor logic inside Launchpad.
- Do not keep separate “IceMaker Editor” vs “Orbit Editor”.
There is only one: **Amalgamated Editor**.

---

## Success Criteria
- User can create an Ice from an Insight in Launchpad → lands in Amalgamated Editor
- User can create an Ice from URL/Paste/Upload via New Ice modal → lands in Amalgamated Editor
- Library drafts always open Amalgamated Editor
- Navigation is clean: Launchpad / Orbits / Library
