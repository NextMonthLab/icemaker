Yes – please create a build plan. Lock these decisions first:

### Locked decisions
- New default post-login hub: **/launchpad** (can become “Home” in nav)
- Do NOT rebuild the app. This is a **re-ranking + new hub page**.
- Keep existing pages but demote:
  - /orbit/:slug = Orbit Admin (sources, map, data hub)
  - /icemaker = Ice Library (projects/templates) OR redirect to /library?tab=ice
  - /try stays for guest builder
- Design: plain black background, subtle gradient accents, no big purple blocks.

### Build plan requirements
Deliver a phased plan with:
1) Desktop Launchpad first (responsive layout but desktop is primary)
2) Mobile adaptation second (tabs or segmented control + builder as full-screen sheet)
3) Explicit routing rules and fallbacks:
   - If user has 0 Orbits → route to Claim flow
   - If user has >=1 Orbit → route to Launchpad with Orbit selector defaulting to last used
4) Data contracts required for the hub:
   - Insight object fields (title, meaning, confidence, topic tags, segment, source, timestamps)
   - Ice draft object fields (format, tone, output type, insightId trace)
5) A list of components to create:
   - LaunchpadLayout
   - OrbitSelector
   - SignalTiles
   - TopInsightCard
   - InsightFeed + InsightCard (with “Make Ice” CTA)
   - IceBuilderPanel (3 states: empty/selected/draft)
   - RecentStrip (drafts + published with “Made from” trace)
6) Acceptance criteria for v1:
   - User can select an Orbit
   - See signal tiles + insight list
   - Click “Make Ice” → builder fills with selected insight
   - Generate draft → preview state appears
   - Draft is saved and appears in Recent
   - Every draft/published item shows “Made from: [Insight]”

### Implementation order (suggested)
Phase 0: Routing + orbit selection persistence
Phase 1: Launchpad UI skeleton (static)
Phase 2: Wire Orbit metrics + insights feed (real data)
Phase 3: Wire “Make Ice” → builder state + draft generation call
Phase 4: Wire Recent strip (drafts/published)
Phase 5: Power-Up onboarding integration (Orbit Strength + completion moment)
Phase 6: Mobile UX (tabs + builder sheet)
Phase 7: Polish (copy, empty states, loading, errors)
