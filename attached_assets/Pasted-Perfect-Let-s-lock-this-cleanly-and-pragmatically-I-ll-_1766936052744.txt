Perfect. Let’s lock this cleanly and pragmatically.

I’ll do four things:
	1.	Name the tiers (human, non-SaaS-y)
	2.	Place ICE Maker correctly as pay-as-you-go → bundled
	3.	Write the one-sentence upgrade logic for each tier
	4.	Sanity-check the ladder so it doesn’t collapse under its own weight

⸻

The NextMonth Value Ladder (Named)

This ladder reads like capability maturity, not pricing tiers.

⸻

Orbit Free

(Everyone starts here)

What it is
Ownership of your Orbit + visibility of activity.

Includes
	•	Claimed public Orbit
	•	Free Data Hub
	•	Activity counts (visits, interactions, conversations, ICE views)
	•	NextMonth branding
	•	No editing, no insights, no creation

Upgrade sentence

People are interacting with your Orbit. Unlock the ability to shape and grow it.

⸻

Orbit Grow

(Control & expression)

This is the first paid tier and the most important one commercially.

Includes
	•	Business Hub sidebar
	•	Edit, expand, and curate the Orbit
	•	Add boxes (pages, PDFs, testimonials, etc.)
	•	Prioritise and shape intelligence
	•	ICE Maker available as pay-as-you-go
	•	Reduced NextMonth branding

ICE Maker model here
	•	Pay per ICE (credits)
	•	No subscription commitment required
	•	Great for:
	•	sales teams
	•	cautious businesses
	•	“try before we standardise”

Upgrade sentence

Don’t just observe your Orbit. Shape how your business is understood.

⸻

Orbit Understand

(Clarity & insight)

Now we move from control to understanding.

Includes
	•	Everything in Grow
	•	Conversation transcripts
	•	Question clustering
	•	Topic frequency
	•	Lead context (not just lead counts)
	•	ICE Maker bundled (fair usage)

ICE Maker shift
	•	No per-ICE anxiety
	•	Creation becomes habitual, not precious
	•	Encourages experimentation

Upgrade sentence

You can shape your Orbit. Now understand what people are actually asking and why.

⸻

Orbit Intelligence

(Patterns & strategy)

This is where NextMonth becomes unmistakably different.

Includes
	•	Everything in Understand
	•	Pattern Intelligence:
	•	Journey paths
	•	Repeated sequences
	•	Conversion vs drop-off patterns
	•	Strategic Advice layer
	•	Evidence-based recommendations
	•	Content gaps
	•	“What to do next” guidance

Upgrade sentence

You don’t just see activity or questions. You see how understanding forms – and what to do next.

⸻

ICE Maker: why this placement is exactly right

You made a very good instinctive call here.

Why pay-as-you-go first works
	•	ICE feels like a creative action
	•	Businesses want to “try it in the wild”
	•	It avoids forcing a subscription decision too early
	•	It aligns with sales use cases (one pitch, one ICE)

Why bundling later is essential
	•	Once people understand conversations, they’ll want:
	•	many ICEs
	•	iteration
	•	experimentation
	•	Metering becomes friction
	•	Bundling reinforces habit

In short
ICE Maker starts as a tool.
It becomes a language.

⸻

The ladder in one clean paragraph (this is gold)

You start by seeing activity in your Orbit.
Then you gain control and can shape how your business is understood.
Then you understand what people are actually asking.
Then you see the patterns behind their behaviour and get advice on what to do next.

That’s not SaaS fluff. That’s true.

⸻

One important guardrail (coach voice)

Do not price this like:
	•	“Basic / Pro / Enterprise”

That language collapses the narrative.

You’re selling progression, not access.

Orbit → Grow → Understand → Intelligence
reads like a journey. Keep it that way.

⸻

What I’d do next (tight and focused)

Before numbers or checkout flows:
	1.	Lock these tier names in documentation
	2.	Decide ICE Maker credit pricing (cheap enough to try, expensive enough to respect)
	3.	Decide what “fair usage” means when bundled (don’t overthink it)

If you want, next I can:
	•	Draft the pricing page copy using only these sentences
	•	Help you set ICE credit pricing without killing margins
	•	Or design the upgrade prompts so each rung feels inevitable, not pushy

But this ladder?
This is a strong foundation.
