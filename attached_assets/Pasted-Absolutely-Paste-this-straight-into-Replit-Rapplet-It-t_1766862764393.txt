Absolutely. Paste this straight into Replit (Rapplet). It tells it to keep the functional Smart Site preview, and add a Cinematic Story Mode spine on top without ripping anything up.

You are Rapplet inside the NextScene repo.

Mission
Take the existing Smart Site Preview (/preview/:id) and wrap a Cinematic Story Mode around it.
Do NOT remove the current functional scaffold. Add a cinematic card sequence as the primary opening experience, then flow naturally into the existing sections and chat overlay.

Outcome
The preview should feel like:
“Your website, rendered in Smart Mode”
with:
- a cinematic card sequence up top (Story Mode)
- the familiar mini-site scaffold below (Structure Mode)
- AI chat as a contextual amplifier (not the whole page)

Non negotiables
1) Keep all existing safety controls intact (SSRF, caps, TTL, rate limits).
2) Use real source content first, not AI rewritten copy.
3) Story Mode must be additive and lightweight (no big performance regressions).
4) UK English spelling. Avoid long dashes in copy.
5) Chat stays secondary. Prefer “Ask about this” on cards and sections.

What we have now
- /preview/:id loads identity (logo/fav/colour) and renders a mini-site scaffold:
  hero, what we do, common questions etc.
- Chat is available via “Ask about this page” and can open as an overlay/drawer.

What we need to build (Cinematic Story Mode)
A) Add a cinematic “Story Mode” section at the top of the Preview page:
- 4 to 6 cards max
- full-width / full-bleed visual style on mobile
- each card contains:
  - an image (prefer heroImageUrl, otherwise derive a gradient using primaryColour)
  - a short headline (use real extracted heroHeadline or headings)
  - 1 short supporting line (from real heroDescription or nearby paragraphs)
  - optional micro-CTA: “Ask about this” (opens chat with contextual prompt)
- navigation:
  - swipe/scroll snapping on mobile (CSS scroll-snap) OR simple next/prev arrows
  - a subtle progress indicator (dots)
- at the end of the card sequence, show a clear affordance:
  “Explore the full Smart Site” (scrolls down to the scaffold)

B) Define the Story Card mapping rules (use extracted content)
Use existing stored identity/content on preview_instances (siteIdentity JSON) to populate cards without re-scraping.

Suggested mapping:
Card 1: Identity + tagline
- image: heroImageUrl or gradient
- headline: site title or heroHeadline
- support: shortest strong line from heroDescription or first paragraph

Card 2: The problem / tension
- use a sentence from heroDescription/first paragraph if it contains a “pain” theme
- fallback: first meaningful paragraph sentence

Card 3: What we do
- headline: “What we do”
- support: 2-3 serviceHeadings shown as pill labels
- micro-CTA: “Ask what’s included in {topService}”

Card 4: Why choose us
- pull from headings like “Why choose”, “About”, “Our approach”, or similar
- fallback: pick the strongest non-service heading

Card 5: Common questions
- show 2-3 faqCandidates as tappable items
- each tap opens chat with that exact question prefilled/sent

Optional Card 6: Next step
- headline: “Ready to activate?”
- support: “Keep this Smart Site live and capture leads it uncovers.”
- CTA: “Claim and activate” (same existing action)

C) Contextual chat integration
- Replace any generic “Try asking…” prompts with contextual prompts derived from the card content.
- When user taps “Ask about this” on a card:
  - open ChatOverlay
  - prefill a question relevant to that card, eg:
    - “Tell me more about {serviceHeading}”
    - “Who is this best for?”
    - “What’s the next step to get started?”

D) Keep the functional scaffold beneath
After Story Mode, the user should naturally scroll into the existing mini-site sections.
Do not remove them. They provide credibility and detail.

E) Hide counters and limits
- Do not show message counters upfront.
- Only show paywall modal when cap reached (existing behaviour).
- Keep “expires in X” line, but keep it subtle.

Implementation notes
- Prefer pure CSS for the cinematic card UX (scroll-snap) to minimise dependencies.
- Create small, reusable components:
  - StoryMode.tsx
  - StoryCard.tsx
  - ProgressDots.tsx (optional)
- Keep styles consistent with NextScene aesthetic but let primaryColour influence accents.

Files likely to touch
- client/src/pages/PreviewPage.tsx (integrate Story Mode at top)
- client/src/components/preview/StoryMode.tsx (new)
- client/src/components/preview/StoryCard.tsx (new)
- client/src/components/preview/ChatOverlay.tsx (minor updates for prefill trigger)
- shared/schema.ts + server ingestion ONLY if any required identity fields are missing (avoid if already present)

Acceptance criteria
1) On /preview/:id, the first thing I see is a cinematic card sequence using real content from the source site.
2) It feels like the brand (logo/fav, colour, imagery) within 3 seconds.
3) I can tap “Ask about this” on a card and chat opens with a relevant question.
4) I can scroll into the detailed Smart Site scaffold afterwards.
5) No new scraping on page load beyond the stored siteIdentity JSON.
6) Existing caps, TTL, SSRF and rate limiting still work.

Now do the work:
- Inspect current PreviewPage implementation and identity data shape.
- Add Story Mode with minimal diffs.
- Ensure mobile UX is smooth.
- Commit changes with a clear message and summarise how to test.

If Rapplet builds that, you’ll have exactly the hybrid you described: cinematic front door + credible structure + smart conversation.

When it’s done, send me a screen recording or a couple of screenshots and I’ll help you tune the card order and copy so it hits emotionally, not just visually.
