This audit is genuinely useful, because it exposes the real problem: naming + routing ambiguity, not “two builders”.

My opinion: do (1) and (2), in a specific order, and add one extra move that will stop this confusion from resurfacing.

Priority order

1) Add the full Title Pack selector to ICE Preview (/ice/preview/:id)

Do this first because it directly impacts “CapCut-level polish” and the user-visible experience.

What “full” means (minimum spec):
	•	Same caption preset engine as the builder (12 presets / 5 animations / 6 title styles, if that’s your target set)
	•	Selector UI shows:
	•	Title Pack name
	•	1-line description
	•	Thumbnail preview
	•	“Apply” action
	•	Changes apply instantly in preview and persist to the ICE record
	•	Locked behaviour: preview and editor must look identical in styling (no “preview looks cheaper” drift)

Add health points
	•	ICEPREV_001 Preview loads for valid id (Critical)
	•	ICEPREV_002 Title Pack selector renders (High)
	•	ICEPREV_003 Selecting a pack updates renderables + persists (High)
	•	ICEPREV_004 Preview render uses same token system as builder (High)
	•	ICEPREV_005 No fallback styling used (Red if fallback)

2) Clean up the IceMaker navigation shell (Projects/Templates)

Do this second because right now it’s false choice architecture: it looks like features exist, but they don’t. That quietly damages trust.

Two acceptable approaches (pick one, I recommend A):

A) Hide/disable until real
	•	Remove Projects/Templates from nav, or mark clearly as “Coming soon”
	•	Keep Home + Create + Settings only
	•	Templates can remain if they actually create a prefilled ICE (not just link to create)

B) Make them minimally real
	•	Projects: list recent ICEs from local storage / API (even if basic)
	•	Templates: actually instantiate a new ICE with that template ID, not just route to create

Add health points
	•	ICENAV_001 Nav shows only functional links (High)
	•	ICENAV_002 Projects page not accessible unless functional (High) or shows real list (if you build it)
	•	ICENAV_003 Templates create a prefilled ICE (High) or are hidden (High)

3) The extra move you need: rename /preview/:id in UI copy to “Orbit Preview”

You don’t necessarily need to change the route immediately, but you must eliminate the conceptual collision.

In UI labels and internal naming:
	•	/preview/:id = Orbit Preview
	•	/ice/preview/:id = ICE Preview

Add a banner on Orbit Preview (admin-only is fine):

“This is Orbit site preview, not ICE playback.”

Add health point
	•	PREVIEW_001 Orbit Preview clearly labelled as Orbit (Medium)

One “no fragmentation” rule to enforce

Any new page must pass:
	•	“Is this inside the correct product area?”
	•	“Does it duplicate an existing route?”
	•	“Is there a Health Contract item for it?”

If not: it doesn’t ship.

What to tell the implementer (copy/paste)

If you want something you can paste straight back:
	•	“Yes: implement the Title Pack selector on /ice/preview/:id as top priority. Then remove or clearly disable non-functional Projects/Templates navigation. Also rename all UI references so /preview/:id is explicitly ‘Orbit Preview’ and never mentioned as ICE. Add the health points listed so we can’t regress.”

If you paste me the current route map (just the list of ICE and Orbit routes), I’ll write a tight “route ownership” contract so this never happens again.
