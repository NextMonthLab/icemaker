SYSTEM CONTEXT – ICE MAKER

We are finalising IceMaker’s media storage and pricing architecture.

IceMaker must fully support:
- Bring-Your-Own (BYO) media
- Non-interactive (linear) ICEs
- Optional AI generation and optional interactive chat (never required)

AI and interactivity are power features, not defaults.

---

1. MEDIA STORAGE STRATEGY (MANDATORY)

We are explicitly choosing:
- Object storage for ALL uploaded media (video, images, audio, PDFs)
- Relational database for metadata ONLY

Media must NOT be stored in the database.

Expected characteristics:
- Video-heavy workloads
- Long-term asset retention
- Multi-tenant SaaS
- Predictable, controlled costs

Required behaviour:
- Client uploads directly to object storage using pre-signed URLs
- Server must never proxy large uploads
- Buckets private by default
- Media served via signed URLs or token-gated CDN access

Please:
- Confirm this is the correct architecture for IceMaker
- Identify any missing components (cleanup jobs, quotas, lifecycle rules, background processing, etc.)
- Advise whether we should:
  A) Store originals only, or
  B) Generate and store web-optimised variants (especially for video)

---

2. OBJECT STORAGE RECOMMENDATION (ICE MAKER SPECIFIC)

Recommend the best object storage solution for IceMaker, considering:
- Cost predictability at scale
- Video delivery economics
- CDN egress costs
- Integration complexity
- Long-term SaaS viability

Explicitly consider:
- Cloudflare R2
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure Blob Storage
- Cloudinary (as a media layer, not raw storage)

Deliver:
- Your recommended default choice
- Clear reasoning
- Any scaling or cost risks we should plan for now

3. PROPOSED PRICING MODEL (FOR VALIDATION)

ICE Starter – £19.99 / month
- Up to 5 ICEs
- BYO media only
- Linear playback only (no chat)
- 5 GB total storage
- Titles, captions, layouts
- Shareable ICE links

ICE Creator – £39.99 / month
- Up to 15 ICEs
- BYO media
- Optional AI generation (credits-based)
- Linear OR interactive ICEs
- 25 GB total storage
- Chapters and light branching

ICE Studio – £79.99 / month
- Up to 50 ICEs
- Full AI generation options
- Interactive characters with memory
- 100 GB total storage
- ICE analytics and branding

ICE Enterprise – Custom
- Custom ICE limits
- 500 GB+ storage
- Compliance, SSO, SLAs

Storage add-ons:
- +50 GB → £10 / month
- +100 GB → £18 / month
- +500 GB → £60 / month

4. ARCHITECTURE & COST SANITY CHECK (CRITICAL)

Audit the above pricing against the real IceMaker system architecture, including:
- Object storage costs
- CDN egress / delivery
- Metadata database growth
- AI generation (LLM, images, video, audio)
- Background workers / pipelines
- Worst-case scenarios (large videos, long retention, high concurrency)

Please:
- Confirm whether pricing is sustainable
- Flag any hidden or underestimated cost centres
- Recommend changes if storage allowances or pricing are misaligned

---

5. REQUIRED OUTPUT

Respond with:
1. Recommended object storage solution + rationale
2. Confirmed storage + metadata architecture
3. Missing components we should add now
4. Pricing validation or suggested adjustments
5. Clear implementation next steps

GOAL:
IceMaker must feel professional, predictable, and scalable.
Storage economics must remain sane as we grow.
AI and interactivity must remain optional accelerators, not mandatory costs.
