Here’s a Replit prompt you can paste in that should get you a properly modern “pro” UI, without the neon sweetshop vibes. 👊🏻

Replit Prompt: Modernise the ICE Maker Edit Screen UI (Professional, Clean, Mobile-First)

Context

We have an “ICE Maker” edit screen that currently feels busy and a bit “prototypey”. There are too many competing colours, a redundant “Professional Editor” pill, and some interaction patterns that hide important info (titles behind toggles). We want the edit screen to look like a modern paid product.

You must update the UI to feel closer to Linear, Notion, Stripe, Superhuman, CapCut level polish, but still aligned to NextMonth’s dark theme and purple accent.

Key UI problems to fix
	1.	Remove the “Professional Editor” pill entirely. It’s redundant and adds visual noise.
	2.	The eye icon should be a Play button (it currently reads as “view” rather than “preview/play”).
	3.	Card titles must never be hidden behind an expansion toggle. The title is the primary anchor and must always be visible. Expanding should reveal secondary details only.
	4.	Reduce competing colours. Keep a single accent system (purple) and neutral surfaces. No random green pills competing with purple.
	5.	Improve hierarchy, spacing, and consistency so the screen looks intentional, not assembled.

Desired outcome

A cleaner, more professional edit screen with:
	•	A compact, confident header
	•	Clear project title and status
	•	A strong, consistent primary action layout
	•	A scrollable card list where titles are always visible
	•	Collapsible panels for advanced controls
	•	Consistent buttons, badges, and icon styling

⸻

Design Rules (Non-negotiable)

Colour and style system
	•	Use one primary accent: NextMonth purple (and optional subtle gradient only on primary CTA).
	•	Everything else should be neutral: dark background, subtle surface panels, grey borders, restrained highlights.
	•	No bright green “success” styling except tiny confirmations or subtle icons. Do not use green pills.
	•	Borders should be subtle and consistent (one border colour token).
	•	Shadows should be minimal and soft, not heavy glow.

Type and hierarchy
	•	Screen title should not repeat itself.
	•	Use a single H1 (project title), then a short supporting line, then controls.
	•	Keep line lengths sensible on mobile.

Buttons
	•	One clear primary CTA per section.
	•	Secondary actions look secondary (ghost / outline).
	•	Icon buttons should be consistent size, padding, and hover states.

⸻

Layout Changes

1) Replace the top “hero” block with a compact header

Current: giant “Professional ICE Editor” hero and a pill.
New: compact header that feels like a real editor.

Header structure (sticky)
	•	Left: NextMonth logo (small)
	•	Centre: Project title (editable inline or read-only)
	•	Right: Publish button, overflow menu, avatar

Under header (still near top, not huge):
	•	A small status row: “Unlisted” badge (neutral), “5 cards”, last saved time
	•	Keep status subtle. No chunky pills.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	“Professional ICE Editor” hero heading removed.
	•	“Professional Editor” pill removed.
	•	Project title becomes the main heading.

2) Project controls row: Preview and Start Over

Replace the current row with a clean control bar:
	•	Primary: Preview / Play (icon + label). This is where the Play icon belongs.
	•	Secondary: Start Over
	•	Optional: Export Video and Project Bible can sit as secondary actions, but not competing.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Eye icon replaced with a Play icon.
	•	The Play button reads as “Preview” or “Play Preview”.
	•	Buttons are aligned and consistent.

3) “Generate All AI Media” becomes a clean panel

Current panel is loud (purple heavy) and competes with everything.

New:
	•	A neutral surface card with a clear title and short helper text.
	•	Inside: two segmented buttons or tabs: Images (4), Videos (1)
	•	Primary CTA: “Review and generate” or “Generate all” depending on flow.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Panel looks neutral, not glowing.
	•	Tabs look modern (segmented control).
	•	The copy is short and clear.

4) Background music + narration panel

This should feel like editor settings, not another hero block.
	•	Neutral surface
	•	Clear labels
	•	Slider styling consistent with theme

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Clean spacing, not visually heavy.

5) Advanced Caption Settings

This is important, but should not dominate.
	•	Collapsible panel with a clear title
	•	Show current selection as a small subtitle (eg “Karaoke: On”)
	•	Tabs: Styles, Effects, Layout should be proper segmented tabs
	•	Preset tiles should have consistent sizes and spacing, with clear selected state

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Panel collapse/expand icon is clear.
	•	Tabs don’t look disabled unless genuinely disabled.
	•	Preset tiles are readable on mobile.

6) Card list redesign (this is the biggest win)

Current list hides too much behind toggles and feels flat.

New card row design:
Each row shows:
	•	Left: card number in a subtle pill
	•	Main: Title always visible, then one-line excerpt under it (always visible)
	•	Right: icons for media state (image/video present), and a chevron for expand details
	•	Expand reveals ONLY secondary fields (script body, prompt details, advanced settings), not the title.

Also:
	•	Replace the floating plus buttons between cards with a cleaner “Add card” row at the bottom, or a small inline add control that doesn’t interrupt scanning.
	•	Make each card row feel tappable with clear hover/pressed states.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	Titles are always visible without expanding anything.
	•	Expand toggle exists but only controls secondary details.
	•	Tapping a card opens edit, but the UI communicates what is tappable vs expandable.

7) Remove or rethink “Unlock Premium Features” panel (if in Pro mode)

If the user is in Professional Editor mode, premium lock UI should not appear. If it’s needed for non-pro:
	•	Keep it minimal and consistent with the rest of the editor
	•	No big dashed outlines
	•	It should not feel like a random landing page section inside the editor

Acceptance criteria:
	•	In Pro mode: no premium unlock panel.
	•	In non-pro mode: premium panel looks consistent and restrained.

Implementation Guidance (Engineer-facing)
	1.	Create a small design token map for:
	•	surfaces (bg, panel, elevated)
	•	border colour
	•	text colours (primary, secondary, muted)
	•	accent (purple)
	2.	Refactor the edit screen into clear components:
	•	EditorHeader
	•	ProjectMetaBar
	•	ActionBar
	•	MediaBatchPanel
	•	AudioPanel
	•	CaptionSettingsPanel
	•	CardList
	•	CardListItem
	3.	Ensure mobile-first spacing and sticky header works on iOS Safari.
	4.	Remove any duplicate headings and reduce vertical padding above the fold.
	5.	Add subtle motion: hover/press states, panel expand transitions (fast, understated).

⸻

Deliverables
	•	Update the ICE Maker edit screen to match the new layout and rules.
	•	Provide before/after screenshots (or at least a short summary of what changed).
	•	Ensure no functionality is removed, only reorganised and restyled.
	•	Ensure the design remains consistent in both Preview and Professional Editor modes.

⸻
