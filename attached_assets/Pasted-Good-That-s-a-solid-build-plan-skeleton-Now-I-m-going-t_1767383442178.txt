Good. That’s a solid build plan skeleton. Now I’m going to be a bit ruthless and tighten it so it’s actually implementable in your codebase without “mystery object” drift.

1) Fix the data contracts (small but important)

Insight Object: add the bits you’ll need in UI

You’ll want these, otherwise you’ll end up hacking around later:
	•	kind (top insight vs normal insight, or category)
	•	updatedAt (so you can sort by freshness)
	•	metricsHint (optional: “why is this top?”)
	•	actionSuggestedFormats (optional, but nice)

Suggested:

type Insight = {
  id: string
  orbitId: string
  title: string
  meaning: string
  confidence: "high" | "medium" | "low"
  topicTags: string[]
  segment?: string
  source: string
  kind?: "top" | "feed"
  createdAt: string // ISO
  updatedAt?: string // ISO
}

Ice Draft Object: avoid content: object as a black hole

If you leave it as object, the UI will become inconsistent and impossible to evolve.

Give it a minimal stable shape now:

type IceDraft = {
  id: string
  orbitId: string
  insightId: string
  format: "hook_bullets" | "myth_reality" | "checklist" | "problem_solution_proof"
  tone: "direct" | "warm" | "playful" | "premium"
  outputType: "video_card" | "interactive"
  status: "draft" | "published"
  headline: string
  captions: string[]       // for card/scene captions
  ctaText?: string
  previewFrameUrl?: string // optional later
  createdAt: string        // ISO
  publishedAt?: string     // ISO
}

Also: include orbitId on drafts. You’ll need it to filter recents when switching orbits.

2) Add one missing concept: Orbit “state”

Because your Launchpad needs to know whether to show “Power up Orbit”.

type OrbitStatus = "basic" | "powered"

type OrbitSummary = {
  id: string
  name: string
  status: OrbitStatus
  strengthScore?: number // 0-100 optional
}

3) Tighten the component list

Your component list is good. Add these two to prevent UI glue code:
	•	LaunchpadHeader (OrbitSelector + status pill + actions)
	•	EmptyStates (no orbit, no insights, no drafts)

And ensure IceBuilderPanel accepts a strict props shape:
	•	selectedInsight?: Insight
	•	onGenerateDraft(...)
	•	draft?: IceDraft

4) Build tasks: reorder into real phases (so it ships)

Here’s the order that will actually work without getting stuck:

Phase 0: Routing + state
	•	Create /launchpad
	•	Make it default post-login route
	•	Persist last selected orbit (localStorage or DB)
	•	If user has 0 orbits → route to claim flow

Phase 1: Layout skeleton (static)
	•	Two columns + bottom strip
	•	Header with orbit selector + status pill + buttons

Phase 2: Real Orbit data on the left
	•	Signal tiles wired to Data Hub metrics
	•	Insights list wired to your current insight source (even if it’s placeholder copy initially, it must be real objects)

Phase 3: “Make Ice” handshake
	•	Clicking insight populates builder state
	•	Format/tone/output controls functional
	•	Generate draft triggers your existing Ice generation route or a stub endpoint

Phase 4: Draft persistence + Recent strip
	•	Save draft record
	•	Show recent drafts/published with “Made from” trace
	•	Click trace scrolls/selects the insight (or opens the insight detail)

Phase 5: Power-Up onboarding integration
	•	Banner/pill shows “Basic scan”
	•	CTA opens Power-Up wizard
	•	On completion: orbit status becomes “powered”
	•	Return to launchpad with “after” moment

Phase 6: Mobile UX
	•	Tabs: Insights | Builder | Recent
	•	Sticky “Build from this” button after selecting insight
	•	Builder as full-screen sheet

Phase 7: Polish
	•	Copy, empty states, loading skeletons, error states

5) Acceptance criteria for v1 (ship gate)

If these are true, you ship:
	•	User lands on Launchpad after login
	•	Can switch orbits
	•	Sees metrics + at least a few insights
	•	Clicks “Make Ice” and generates a draft
	•	Draft appears in Recent immediately
	•	Every draft shows “Made from: Insight”
	•	Power-Up CTA is visible when orbit is basic

6) One note on naming

Don’t call it “Launchpad” in the logo/top left if you can avoid it. Keep product name as NextMonth and make the page label Studio or Launchpad in nav. Small thing, but it feels more premium.

If you paste this back to Redblood, they’ll have a build plan that’s tight enough to implement without “content object” chaos or routing confusion.
