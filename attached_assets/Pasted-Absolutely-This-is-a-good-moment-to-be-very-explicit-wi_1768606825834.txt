Absolutely. This is a good moment to be very explicit with Replit, because what you’re describing is not a “nice to have” — it’s a trust issue between UI and output. If we say 10 seconds, it must be 10 seconds, or we clearly explain why not.

Below is a clean, authoritative Replit prompt you can paste straight in. It explains the problem, the required behaviour, and the acceptable fallback — without over-engineering.

Prompt for Replit (iSmaker / Video Generation Logic)

Context
In iSmaker, users can currently select a target video duration (e.g. 5s, 10s). However, regardless of selection, the system is only generating ~5-second video clips, and when longer narration exists, the same clip is being looped multiple times. This creates a visibly repetitive and low-quality result.

We need to address this at two levels:
(1) Correct duration handling, and
(2) A deliberate, cinematic fallback when true duration cannot be achieved.

⸻

1. Duration Accuracy (Primary Requirement)
	•	If the user selects 10 seconds, the system must attempt to generate a single, continuous 10-second video.
	•	Please audit the video generation pipeline and confirm:
	•	Whether the selected duration value is being passed to the video generation model.
	•	Whether the model or endpoint supports variable durations (e.g. 10s vs 5s).
	•	If the model does support 10-second output:
	•	Ensure the correct parameter is sent.
	•	Ensure no hard-coded defaults are overriding the user selection.

Important:
We should not present a 10-second option in the UI unless the system is genuinely attempting to generate a 10-second clip.

⸻

2. No Video Looping (Hard Rule)
	•	Do not loop or repeat a short video clip to fill time.
	•	Repeating identical motion is visually jarring and breaks narrative immersion.

If a video ends before the associated dialogue finishes, the system should transition deliberately, not loop.

⸻

3. Cinematic Continuation Fallback (Secondary Requirement)

If the model is limited to shorter clips (e.g. 5 seconds), or if longer generation fails:
	•	The video should play once only.
	•	After the video ends, automatically generate a context-aware continuation image (still image).

Continuation image generation rules:
	•	Use the original video prompt as context.
	•	Analyse the remaining dialogue for that card.
	•	Generate a still image that:
	•	Advances the narrative visually
	•	Focuses on objects, environment details, or scene elements mentioned in the dialogue
	•	Feels like a cinematic cutaway (e.g. wide shot → close-up)

Example:
	•	Video: “Sir Isaac Newton in his study by a window”
	•	Remaining dialogue mentions a book
	•	Continuation image: “Close-up of a leather-bound scientific book on a wooden desk, candlelit, 17th-century study”

This image should persist on screen while the remaining dialogue is narrated.

⸻

4. UX Alignment
	•	If true 10-second videos are supported and working → keep the 10s option.
	•	If not → either:
	•	Fix the pipeline so duration is honoured, or
	•	Clearly adjust the UI to reflect actual behaviour and rely on the cinematic continuation pattern.

The key requirement is honesty and visual quality.
The system must never appear to “fake” duration through looping.

⸻

Outcome Goal
iSmaker videos should feel intentional and cinematic:
	•	One continuous video where possible
	•	One video + motivated still image where necessary
	•	No repetition, no filler, no visible hacks

Straight talk, Rob

This prompt does three important things:
	1.	It forces Replit to audit the pipeline, not guess
	2.	It gives them a clear success condition (10 seconds means 10 seconds)
	3.	It gives them a safe, elegant fallback that protects quality even if the model is limited

You’re setting a professional bar here — not blaming the tech, just refusing to ship something that feels broken.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Add acceptance criteria (so you can test it quickly)
	•	Or write a UI microcopy update that explains this beautifully to users without mentioning limitations

This is the right call.
