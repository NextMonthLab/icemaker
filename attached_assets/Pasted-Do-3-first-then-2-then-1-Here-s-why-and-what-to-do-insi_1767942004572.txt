Do 3 first, then 2, then 1.

Here’s why (and what to do inside each), with zero faffing about.

Priority order

3) Build the CPAC-driven front page components (do this now)

Because your biggest risk right now isn’t importer correctness, it’s that Smart Glasses still feels like “a database behind a chat box”.

You already have enough data (4 concepts, 7 entities, 9 products, 6 tiles, 5 communities, 2 pulse sources) to make a premium hub. The UI is what turns this into something monetisable.

Front page layout (CPAC-driven, auto-hiding empty sections):
	1.	Hero: Smart Glasses + one-line value + 2 CTAs
	•	CTA 1: Get weekly Smart Glasses updates (Friend)
	•	CTA 2: Unlock Influencer mode (paid)
	2.	Brand strip (logos) OR if no logos, show Brand cards (name + “latest tile count” + “products count”)
	3.	Featured products (needs intentTags; until then, fallback to “Most viewed” or “Newest imported”)
	4.	Latest updates (tiles)
	5.	Start here (core concepts + starter questions)
	6.	Communities (with regionTags)
	7.	Pulse sources (small, credible footer section: “Sources we monitor”)

Important: if logos are missing, don’t leave a blank. Show a clean “Brands” row with initials placeholders. That still feels designed.

Also fix the visible data issues in the UI layer while you’re here:
	•	Hide / quarantine anything flagged legacy-bad (orphan products, invalid status) with a badge:
	•	“Needs data cleanup” (admin only)
	•	Public users should never see “Mystery Glasses”.

2) Add quality score/grade/summary (next)

Once the UI is premium, you want the pipeline to be operationally smooth.

Add these to the import response:
	•	hasBlockingIssues (bool)
	•	blockingIssuesCount
	•	qualityScore (0–100)
	•	grade (A/B/C/D)
	•	summary (one line)

Suggested scoring (simple, effective):
	•	Start 100
	•	-30 for each ERROR/CRITICAL
	•	-10 for each WARNING
	•	INFO doesn’t reduce score

Grade:
	•	A: 90–100
	•	B: 80–89
	•	C: 65–79
	•	D: <65

This gives you a single number to drive automation and “safe to publish” logic.

1) Severity upgrade for missing manufacturer ref (last, but still do it)

This is polish. You already did strict skipping + warnings, which is the real protection.

Upgrade:
	•	MISSING_MANUFACTURER_REF severity -> ERROR
	•	hasBlockingIssues: true if any ERRORs
	•	Keep success: true if you want non-blocking imports, but make it explicit it’s not clean.

What you should ask Rapplet to do immediately (copy/paste)

Instruction:
	1.	Build /orbit/:slug front page sections (Hero, Brands, Featured Products, Latest Tiles, Start Here, Communities, Sources).
	2.	Each section must auto-hide if its count is zero.
	3.	Add a fallback “Brands row without logos” using entity initials until logoAssetId exists.
	4.	Add “featured products” selection logic:
	•	first choice: intentTags includes featured
	•	fallback: newest imported / most viewed / highest spec completeness
	5.	Add “data cleanup safety”:
	•	Public UI must not show products with missing manufacturer or invalid status
	•	Admin UI can show them with a “needs cleanup” badge and a fix action link.

⸻

One more thing: fix your current data before you judge the UI

Right now you’ve got:
	•	3 orphan products
	•	“Mystery Glasses”
	•	invalid status values (“available”)

If you build the front page and it still feels messy, it won’t be the UI’s fault, it’ll be the legacy data.

So alongside the front page build, have Rapplet run a one-time cleanup migration:
	•	Delete or quarantine “Mystery Glasses”
	•	For orphan products:
	•	either map to correct manufacturer
	•	or set status = "draft" and hide from public
	•	Convert available -> shipping (only if it truly means shipping, otherwise set unknown)

No hero section can survive a poisoned dataset.

If you want, I’ll write the exact acceptance criteria for the front page (what “done” looks like), so you can keep Rapplet tight and avoid “it’s built but it’s still underwhelming”.
