Replit Prompt: IceMaker UI refinement – align with NextMonth, preserve cinematic individuality

Context
IceMaker is an intentional, cinematic part of the NextMonth platform. It is distinct from Orbit and should remain emotionally expressive, story-led, and immersive.

We do NOT want to redesign IceMaker.
We do NOT want to make it look like Orbit.
We do NOT want to flatten its personality.

The goal is subtle alignment, not homogenisation.

This work is about polish, discipline, and consistency, not reinvention.

---

Core design principle
IceMaker should feel like:
- The cinema or stage
Orbit should feel like:
- The control room or intelligence layer

They are part of the same system, but they operate in different emotional modes.

---

Non-negotiables
1. Preserve IceMaker’s individuality and cinematic tone.
2. Keep the existing IceMaker layout and interaction patterns.
3. Do NOT introduce Orbit UI patterns into IceMaker.
4. Do NOT add analytics, admin language, or business framing into IceMaker.
5. Changes should be subtle and incremental, not disruptive.
6. Avoid long dash characters in UI copy.

---

Typography rules
IceMaker currently uses a theatrical / cinematic font.

Refine usage as follows:
- Cinematic font:
  - Allowed ONLY for:
    - Primary headings
    - Experience titles
    - Section headers that signal narrative or story context
- System / standard UI font:
  - Use for:
    - Body copy
    - Buttons
    - Inputs
    - Labels
    - Navigation
    - Helper text
    - Modals

This keeps the cinematic feel intentional and premium, not overwhelming.

Do not remove the cinematic font entirely.
Do not apply it globally.

---

Colour system alignment
Align IceMaker with the NextMonth colour system while preserving mood.

Rules:
- Use the same base blacks, neutrals, and accent colours as the wider platform.
- IceMaker may use:
  - Higher contrast
  - Deeper shadows
  - Slightly richer saturation
- Orbit uses:
  - More whitespace
  - Lighter contrast
  - More restraint

IceMaker should feel darker, richer, and more immersive, but not disconnected.

Avoid introducing new colours unless already part of the NextMonth palette.

---

Spacing and rhythm
Make subtle refinements only:
- Slightly standardise spacing between sections where it improves readability.
- Maintain generous vertical spacing to preserve cinematic pacing.
- Avoid dense or “dashboard-like” layouts.

IceMaker should breathe.

---

UI components
Where IceMaker uses buttons, inputs, or controls:
- Reuse the same underlying component styles as NextMonth where possible.
- Allow IceMaker-specific treatments:
  - Softer edges
  - Slight glow or gradient usage
  - Darker surfaces

Components should feel related, not identical.

---

Motion and interaction
If motion exists:
- Keep it slow, deliberate, and minimal.
- No flashy or distracting animations.
- Focus on subtle fades, transitions, and easing that reinforce immersion.

IceMaker motion should feel like film pacing, not UI flair.

---

What not to change
- Do not change the IceMaker library layout at /app.
- Do not add Orbit language, metrics, or business terminology.
- Do not change the core navigation structure.
- Do not remove the sense that IceMaker is its own “mode” within NextMonth.

---

Success criteria
The IceMaker UI should:
- Feel clearly part of NextMonth
- Retain its cinematic and emotional identity
- Feel more disciplined and intentional
- Avoid feeling generic or corporate
- Avoid feeling experimental or unstable

If a user moves from IceMaker to Orbit, it should feel like:
“I’ve stepped into a different room of the same building.”

---

Implementation note
This is a refinement pass, not a redesign.

If a change does not clearly improve:
- clarity
- cohesion
- or intentionality

Do not make it.

Return only the updated UI refinements, not exploratory variants.
