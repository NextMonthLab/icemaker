Absolutely. Here’s a clear, authoritative prompt you can send straight to Rappler. It’s framed as an engineering + product feasibility check, not a blue-sky brainstorm, so you’ll get a useful answer back.

Prompt to Rappler: Orbit Catalogue & Menu Ingestion Feasibility

Context

We are exploring a strategic expansion of Orbit into e-commerce and food/takeaway businesses.

These businesses already maintain highly structured data (products, menus, categories, prices, options). The opportunity is for Orbit to ingest this data and re-express it as an explorable, AI-assisted knowledge surface, without replacing existing checkout or POS systems.

Before proceeding, we need a clear assessment of feasibility, limits, and architectural implications.

⸻

Questions to Answer (Be Specific)

1. Catalogue / Menu Ingestion

Can the current Orbit architecture ingest and represent:
	•	Full e-commerce catalogues (hundreds to thousands of products)
	•	Full restaurant / takeaway menus (categories, items, modifiers, prices, allergens)

Please address:
	•	Maximum practical item counts
	•	Required data normalisation or schemas
	•	Whether ingestion is batch, sync-based, or incremental

⸻

2. Data Sources & Integration

From a technical perspective, how viable is ingestion from:
	•	E-commerce platforms (via API or export)
	•	Restaurant menu sources (POS systems, delivery platforms, or structured JSON)

What assumptions would Orbit need to make about:
	•	Data freshness
	•	Update frequency (price changes, availability)
	•	Variant/modifier complexity (sizes, extras, dietary tags)

⸻

3. Tile & Cluster Representation at Scale

Given that Orbit tiles are the core UI unit:
	•	Can tiles scale to 1,000+ items if clustered and virtualised?
	•	What limits exist in the current tile/grid/radar system?
	•	Would large catalogues require a distinct “index layer” vs “orbit view”?

Be explicit about:
	•	Performance constraints
	•	Frontend vs backend bottlenecks
	•	Any required changes to rendering or data loading strategy

⸻

4. AI Understanding & Querying

Assuming large structured datasets:
	•	Can Orbit’s AI layer reason over full catalogues/menus?
	•	Can it support queries like:
	•	“What should I choose?”
	•	“What’s similar to X?”
	•	“What’s popular / underrated / good for Y?”

What additional embedding, indexing, or summarisation steps would be required?

⸻

5. Intelligence & Analytics Potential

From an architecture point of view, could Orbit surface insights such as:
	•	High-interest, low-conversion items
	•	Frequently asked questions per product/menu item
	•	Comparison patterns
	•	Drop-off or confusion signals

If yes:
	•	What data would need to be captured?
	•	What is realistic for an initial MVP vs later phases?

⸻

6. Constraints & Red Flags

Please be honest about:
	•	Hard technical limits
	•	Areas where Orbit would struggle without major rework
	•	Trade-offs between completeness and usability
	•	Anything that would make this a poor fit for Orbit’s current design philosophy

⸻

Output Format Requested

Please respond with:
	1.	Feasible now / feasible with work / not feasible breakdown
	2.	Key architectural changes required (if any)
	3.	A recommended MVP scope for e-commerce or takeaway use
	4.	Clear risks and mitigations

This is an exploration, not a commitment. Accuracy matters more than optimism.

⸻

If you want, once Rappler replies, I’ll:
	•	Translate the response into plain English
	•	Call out what’s genuinely exciting vs hand-wavy
	•	Recommend whether this becomes a core Orbit vertical or a later extension

This is the right question at exactly the right moment.
