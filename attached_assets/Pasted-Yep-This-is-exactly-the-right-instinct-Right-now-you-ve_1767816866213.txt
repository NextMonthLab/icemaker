Yep. This is exactly the right instinct. Right now you’ve basically got two films being edited in parallel using the same footage: “Preview” and “Claimed”. That’s where complexity, bugs, and slow shipping come from.

Here are the specific gaps to prioritise, in the smallest number of consolidation moves, with a hard bias toward one flow, one set of endpoints, one UI, and feature gating instead of duplication.

The 4 gaps that actually matter

1) Two chat pipelines (this is your biggest multiplier)

Problem: Preview chat and claimed chat behave differently (video, testimonials, storage, parsing, event tracking). Every improvement becomes “do it twice”.

Goal: One chat route and one response contract, always.

Consolidation decision (strong recommendation):
	•	Single endpoint: POST /api/orbit/:slug/chat
	•	Supports:
	•	Owner (authenticated)
	•	Public viewer (token-based access for previews, sharing, sales demos)
	•	Response always supports the same “capabilities”, but the UI gates what you can actually use.

Why it matters: Chat is the “engine”. Two engines = two futures. Pick one.

2) OrbitView is rendering two different Radars (duplication = drift)

Problem: You’ve got two UI paths: one with video hooks and rich handling, one without. These will drift forever.

Goal: One OrbitView, one RadarGrid, one set of handlers.

Consolidation approach:
	•	RadarGrid gets a single capabilities object like:
	•	canPlayVideo
	•	canCaptureTestimonial
	•	canSaveConversation
	•	canExport
	•	Those are derived from:
	•	claimStatus (preview vs claimed)
	•	planTier
	•	viewerMode (owner vs public)

Outcome: Same UI, same behaviours, just locked/unlocked.

3) Two sources of truth for “business identity”

Problem: preview_instances and orbit_meta overlap. That’s the start of data rot and “why is this different here?” bugs.

Goal: One canonical “business snapshot” record.

Most practical rule:
	•	preview_instances remains canonical for extracted site identity + catalogue + content snapshot.
	•	orbit_meta becomes ownership/settings only (who owns it, plan tier, customisation, flags, etc.)
	•	When claimed, you don’t duplicate identity. You link.

Bonus win: Re-indexing and refresh jobs don’t need to care if it’s preview or claimed. Same pipeline.

⸻

4) Analytics and events diverge (you lose truth + you lose conversion insight)

Problem: Previews don’t track key “wow” moments (video starts, plays, completions). That’s literally your conversion funnel signal.

Goal: Track the same events everywhere, but attribute correctly.

Consolidation approach:
	•	Same event schema for preview + claimed.
	•	Events include:
	•	orbitId (or previewId linked to orbit)
	•	viewerType (public/owner)
	•	sessionId
	•	You can still restrict features in preview, but you should still measure intent.

The “do this first” order (so you stop bleeding complexity)

Phase 1: Unify chat contract (highest leverage)
	1.	Create a shared OrbitChatService used by both modes.
	2.	Route preview chat through the orbit chat endpoint using an access token.
	3.	Ensure preview can receive video suggestions and structured actions, even if playback is gated.

Success test: A preview conversation and a claimed conversation return the same shape of response.

⸻

Phase 2: Unify OrbitView + RadarGrid
	1.	Delete the “second RadarGrid” path.
	2.	Add capabilities gating.
	3.	Make video UI exist in preview but either:
	•	plays a short teaser only, or
	•	shows “unlock to play” overlay.

Success test: One component path, different unlock states.

⸻

Phase 3: Canonical data model
	1.	Remove duplicated identity fields from orbit_meta (or stop reading them).
	2.	Ensure everything reads business context from preview_instances (or a unified view).

Success test: Updating site snapshot updates both preview and claimed instantly.

⸻

Phase 4: Analytics parity
	1.	Same event tracking everywhere.
	2.	Different dashboards if you want, but the data is consistent.

Success test: You can see conversion behaviours from previews clearly.

The main design principle to keep you sane

Preview is not a different product.
It’s the same product in demo mode.

If a feature exists, it should exist in preview as:
	•	fully working,
	•	partially working (teaser),
	•	or visible but locked.

But it should not be a separate implementation.

My blunt take on where you are

You’re not “far off launch”. You’re “one consolidation pass away” from being able to ship confidently.

Right now the risk isn’t that it doesn’t work.
The risk is that you’ll keep shipping at half speed because every change has to be duplicated and QA’d twice.

If you want, paste the key route files + the OrbitView file references you mentioned, and I’ll turn the above into a concrete “surgery list” (exact deletions, merges, and a new unified interface contract).
