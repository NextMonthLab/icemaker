You’re thinking about this the right way: don’t “ask if it’s built”, force Raplet to prove it with file paths, routes, state logic, and a clickable flow.

Here’s how to interrogate Raplet properly so you can confirm whether the Orbit Power-Up journey is genuinely scaffolded (and not just vibes).

⸻

1) Define “Powered Up” in code terms (so it can be verified)

Before you interrogate, make the target concrete:

OrbitStatus = powered when at least:
	•	1+ extra page sources added (About, Services/Pricing, FAQ/Contact)
	•	Social links added OR brand assets selected (logo, images, accent preset)
	•	Ingest job completed successfully (not pending)
	•	Strength score > threshold (even if crude at first)

If Raplet can’t point to where that logic lives, it’s not scaffolded.

⸻

2) The interrogation method: “Show me the evidence”

You want Raplet to answer in this format every time:
	•	Routes: exact paths
	•	Components: exact file paths
	•	State machine: what statuses exist and where they change
	•	Data model: DB tables or persisted objects
	•	Wiring: which endpoints are called on submit
	•	UI proof: what happens when a user clicks through

No evidence = not built.

3) Paste this prompt to Raplet (it will flush out reality fast)

RAPLET: Power-Up Process Scaffold Audit (No hand-waving)

Goal
Confirm whether the Orbit “Power-Up” process exists as a real scaffolded flow, not just UI fragments.

You must respond with EVIDENCE:
- file paths
- route paths
- component names
- which endpoints are called
- where state is stored
- where Orbit status changes

Checklist you must satisfy:

A) Routes and navigation
1) What route starts the power-up wizard? Provide exact route path.
2) What route shows completion and where does it redirect (Launchpad or Orbit Admin)?
3) Is there a guarded redirect (basic -> power-up prompt)? Show logic location.

B) UI components
List each wizard screen component with its file path:
- Step 1: key pages (About, Services/Pricing, FAQ/Contact) with URL or paste toggle
- Step 2: socials + optional brand assets
- Progress/loading state
- Success state + CTA

C) Data storage
1) Where are the user-provided sources stored (DB table or persisted JSON)? Provide schema or interface.
2) Where is Orbit status stored and updated? Show the code line or function.

D) Backend wiring
1) Which endpoint receives the “power-up” payload? Provide route definition file + handler.
2) What does it do: queue ingest job, run immediate scrape, save sources, compute strengthScore.
3) If anything is stubbed, label it clearly as STUB and show TODO.

E) Smoke test
Provide steps to test in the browser in under 2 minutes:
- starting from a basic orbit
- entering sources
- confirming status changes to powered
- seeing insights begin to appear in Launchpad

If any part is missing, list the missing parts as a punch list with file paths to create.

That prompt basically forces a confession if anything is pretend.

4) What “scaffolded” actually means for you (minimum viable)

For your “hooked, no turning back” loop, scaffolded does NOT need perfect AI. It needs:
	•	A wizard that collects sources fast (2 steps)
	•	A status flip (basic -> powered) that is visible everywhere
	•	A drip feed that starts immediately (even if it’s partly templated at first)

If Raplet has built the Launchpad insight feed, you can “drip” with:
	•	1 top insight (always)
	•	3 feed insights (rotating)
	•	Confidence badges that improve as data increases

That’s enough to hook.

⸻

5) The 10-minute “truth test” you do yourself

After Raplet responds, you verify in this order:
	1.	Can you start the wizard from the Orbit area in one click?
	2.	Can you submit at least ONE source and continue?
	3.	Does it save somewhere real (refresh page, still there)?
	4.	Does Orbit status change to Powered Up in the UI?
	5.	Do you see any new insights populate within 30 seconds (even if basic)?

If any answer is “no”, that’s your punch list.

⸻

6) The hook: what to drip so they’re invested

Once powered:
	•	“New insight unlocked” toast after ingest
	•	“Orbit strength increased” indicator (+X)
	•	Launchpad shows: “Powered Up insights are now live” with a subtle glow
	•	First “Make Ice” is pre-selected for them (remove friction)

You’re aiming for: submit pages → feel progress → see insight → generate content.

If you paste the prompt above into Raplet and send me what it replies with, I’ll translate it into a clean pass/fail checklist and the exact next build steps (no fluff).
