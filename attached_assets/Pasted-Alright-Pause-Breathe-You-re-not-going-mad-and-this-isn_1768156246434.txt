Alright. Pause. Breathe. You’re not going mad – and this isn’t “one more tiny padding bug”. There’s a fundamental reason you’re still seeing clipping even after Claude’s “correct architecture” message.

I’m going to be very direct now, because you’re at the point where clarity matters more than optimism.

⸻

The uncomfortable truth (why it’s STILL clipping)

The preview you are looking at is NOT actually using the code Claude just fixed.

Not fully. Not end-to-end.

What you’re seeing is one of these three things (and almost certainly a combination of them):

⸻

1️⃣ The ICE preview is NOT a pure composition renderer

Even though Claude conceptually locked geometry to composition space, your screenshots prove this:
	•	The bubble is being clipped by the viewport, not the composition
	•	The left edge is disappearing, which should be impossible if:
	•	The caption is rendered at 1080px
	•	And the whole thing is scaled with transform: scale()

That means:

👉 Something upstream is still constraining width in DOM space before the scale is applied

Common culprits:
	•	A wrapper with overflow-hidden
	•	A parent with max-width or width: 100%
	•	A Framer Motion wrapper calculating layout before transform
	•	A Tailwind class like w-full, max-w-full, inset-x-*

Claude fixed the math, but the DOM containment is still wrong.

⸻

2️⃣ You now have TWO competing geometry systems alive at once

From your screenshots and Claude’s own admissions:
	•	calculateCaptionGeometry() exists ✅
	•	viewportScale logic still exists ❌
	•	CardPlayer / ICE preview still makes layout decisions ❌

So what’s happening is this:

FIT ENGINE:  "I have 972px, text fits"
RENDER:      "Cool, but I'm inside a narrower DOM box"
BROWSER:     "Left side gets clipped"

This is why you’ve had 25 fixes that all felt “almost right”.

They were fixing symptoms, not ownership.

⸻

3️⃣ The preview is reflowing text before scale is applied

This is the killer detail most people miss:

CSS transform: scale() does NOT affect layout, only paint.

So if the caption bubble is:
	•	Measured
	•	Wrapped
	•	Clipped

before the transform is applied, scaling later will NOT save you.

That means the only safe options are:

Option A (recommended, simple, robust)

Render captions inside a fixed 1080px absolutely-positioned stage, then scale the entire stage.

Option B (harder)

Rebuild the preview so that no DOM width ever affects caption layout.

Right now, you’re in a broken hybrid of both.

⸻

Why Claude keeps “finding the issue” but it never ends

Claude isn’t lying – it is finding real problems each time.

But it’s doing this:
	•	Fix padding
	•	Fix geometry
	•	Fix scale
	•	Fix container width

…without ever being forced to answer one binary question:

❓ Who owns the width: the composition or the DOM?

Until that is answered in code, not comments, you will loop forever.

⸻

The only fix that will ACTUALLY end this

This is the “nuclear but correct” move. No more tweaks.

🔒 Lock the preview to a composition stage

Tell Claude this exactly (do not soften it):

We are done tweaking.

Implement a fixed 1080x1920 composition stage for ICE preview.

Rules:
1) Create a <CompositionStage> div that is exactly 1080px wide.
2) ALL captions render inside this stage using absolute positioning.
3) The stage is the ONLY thing that gets transform: scale().
4) No caption component may read viewport size or DOM width.
5) overflow-hidden may ONLY exist on the stage wrapper, never inside it.
6) Delete or bypass any code that sizes captions based on viewport.

If any caption element uses w-full, max-w-*, clientWidth, or offsetWidth, remove it.

If Claude pushes back, that’s your proof the architecture is still wrong.

⸻

How you can sanity-check this yourself (no code reading)

Do this in DevTools:
	1.	Inspect the caption bubble
	2.	Look at its computed width in pixels
	3.	Ask:
	•	Is this ~972px before scaling?
	•	Or is it something like 340–380px?

If it’s the latter, the preview is still lying to the fit engine.

⸻

One final thing (important)

Your instinct earlier was correct.

When GitHub said:
	•	Accept current
	•	Accept incoming

Claude’s fix would almost certainly have been incoming, not current.

That alone could mean:
	•	Geometry contract exists
	•	But never actually reached the preview path you’re testing

⸻

Bottom line

You are not failing.
The system is in an unstable architectural superposition.

Once you:
	•	Pick composition-space only
	•	Enforce it with a real stage
	•	Scale only the stage

This problem disappears forever.

If you want, next message I can:
	•	Write the exact JSX structure the preview must have
	•	Or help you audit one file to find the last DOM-width offender

You’re absolutely right to be frustrated. You’re also absolutely right about the direction.
