Yes – let’s slow this down and lock the principle first, then we’ll give Radplayers a clean, unambiguous steer.

You’re right: what you’re seeing right now is a hard paywall, and that’s not what we agreed. It breaks trust and it breaks the product story.

⸻

What we agreed (and why it matters)

Claiming an Orbit ≠ Paying customer

Claiming is the on-ramp. Payment is the accelerator.

If someone claims an Orbit and immediately hits an upgrade wall when they click “Manage your Orbit”, the message they receive is:

“This isn’t really yours unless you pay.”

That’s the wrong psychological contract.

What we actually agreed was:

⸻

✅ Free = Ownership + Orientation

💷 Paid = Power + Advantage

Free (after claiming an Orbit)

Users must be able to manage basic, confidence-building functionality.

That includes:

1. Basic Orbit Management (non-negotiable)
	•	View Orbit details (name, category, location)
	•	Confirm they are the owner
	•	See status: claimed / live / dormant

2. Lightweight Analytics (teaser-level)
Enough to answer:

“Is anything happening here?”

For example:
	•	Total visits (lifetime or last 30 days)
	•	Total interactions (blurred or aggregated)
	•	A simple trend indicator (↑ ↓ →)

Not deep insight. Just proof of life.

3. Clear “What You’re Missing” Framing
Inside the free view, we show locked items:
	•	Audience breakdown (locked)
	•	AI insights (locked)
	•	Introductions & recommendations (locked)

This creates desire, not resentment.

⸻

Paid = Strategic Advantage

Upgrade unlocks:
	•	Real intelligence
	•	Personalised insights
	•	Introductions
	•	Competitive positioning
	•	Historical depth
	•	AI recommendations

So the upgrade feels like:

“I can already see this works – now I want the edge.”

Not:

“I can’t even get in.”

⸻

The core rule (this is the line to hold)

Manage your Orbit should NEVER route directly to an upgrade screen.

Upgrade should be:
	•	A choice
	•	Triggered by curiosity
	•	Positioned as advantage, not access

⸻

What’s wrong with the current behaviour

Right now:
	•	User claims Orbit
	•	Clicks Manage your Orbit
	•	Gets forced into upgrade
	•	Cannot manage anything

That’s a hard block, and it contradicts:
	•	Our previous agreements
	•	Good SaaS conversion psychology
	•	The “free claim” promise

You’re absolutely right to flag it.

⸻

Message you can send to Radplayers (pasteable)

Here’s a clean, calm, unambiguous version you can drop straight in:

⸻

When testing as FlashBuzz (boo.flashbuzz.co.uk), I’ve already claimed the Orbit, but when I click “Manage your Orbit” it routes me directly to an upgrade screen, meaning I can’t manage anything at all.

This feels like a hard block and isn’t what we agreed.

Our intention was:
	•	Claiming an Orbit gives users basic management access
	•	Free users can see lightweight analytics (teaser-level, not deep insight)
	•	Upgrade unlocks advanced intelligence, AI insights, and advantages

“Manage your Orbit” should never force an upgrade. It should open a basic management view, with premium features clearly shown as locked.

The upgrade should feel like an advantage, not a gate just to get in.

Can we adjust the routing so claimed Orbits always open a free management view, with upgrade prompts inside it rather than replacing it?

⸻

Final gut-check (and I’ll be blunt)

You’re thinking about this exactly right.

This is the difference between:
	•	A platform people trust
	•	And a platform people bounce off

Fixing this now will materially improve conversion later.

If you want, next step we can:
	•	Define the exact free management screen layout
	•	Or write the microcopy that makes people want to upgrade rather than feel forced

Your call.
