REPLIT BUILD PROMPT (Page Upgrade: /for/creators)

Context
You are working inside the existing NextMonth web codebase.
The route /for/creators already exists and targets creators and filmmakers.

This is an upgrade pass, not a redesign.
Preserve the current dark cinematic visual language, gradients, rounded cards, and component system.

Goal
Make the /for/creators page:
- Clearer in the first 5 seconds
- More filmmaker-specific (less generic AI language)
- More concrete about outputs and next steps
- More conversion-focused on mobile

Non-negotiables
- Do NOT break routing, auth, or the global “Build Experience” button.
- Keep existing layout components where possible.
- UK English spelling.
- No long dashes (—). Use normal hyphens only.
- Add semantic data-nm-* attributes for overlay tooling.
- Improve mobile readability (grey-on-black contrast).
- One clear primary CTA per viewport.

Scope
This prompt applies ONLY to the /for/creators page.
Do not modify the homepage, /for/brands, or shared nav unless required for layout safety.

--------------------------------
SECTION-BY-SECTION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

1) Page wrapper
- Add data-nm-page="for-creators" to the top-level wrapper.
- Ensure only one H1 exists on the page.

--------------------------------

2) Hero section

Keep the core idea but tighten the copy.

Hero badge:
- Keep “For Creators & Filmmakers”

H1 (keep concept, refine wording):
"Your story, one moment at a time"

Subcopy (replace current paragraph with this tone):
"Transform scripts and ideas into cinematic, interactive story experiences.
Built for filmmakers who think in scenes, not pages."

Under the subcopy, add a short “Built for” inline list (3 items max):
- Short films
- Trailers and proof-of-concepts
- Interactive fiction

CTAs:
- Primary button (only one primary above the fold):
  Text: "Build a Story Experience"
  Add data-nm-cta="build-story-experience-hero"

- Secondary text link under the button:
  Text: "See an example experience"
  Add data-nm-cta="see-example-experience"

--------------------------------

3) “From script to screen” section

Section heading:
"From script to screen"

Intro line (1 sentence max):
"Turn written story into a visual, structured experience without losing your voice."

Cards (keep existing cards, rewrite descriptions):

Card 1
Title: "Scripts become story cards"
Description:
"Upload your screenplay, treatment, or outline. Each scene or beat becomes a visual story card."

Card 2
Title: "Cinematic visuals per card"
Description:
"AI generates consistent imagery in your chosen visual style across the entire experience."

Card 3
Title: "Optional character interaction"
Description:
"Let audiences speak to characters between scenes, safely constrained to your story world."

Card 4
Title: "Release your way"
Description:
"Drop everything at once or release scenes daily to build anticipation."

Under the cards, add a small output line:
"Output: cinematic cards, optional character chat, shareable link"

Add data-nm-section="script-to-screen"

--------------------------------

4) Visual Bible System section

Section heading:
"Visual Bible System"

Replace vague language with filmmaker-specific framing.

Body copy (2 short paragraphs max):
"Define your look once. Lens feel, lighting mood, colour palette, and visual tone are locked and applied across every card.

Characters stay recognisable. Locations feel connected. Your visual identity stays intact from first scene to last."

Add a non-functional visual chip row (purely presentational):
- Neo-noir
- Warm naturalism
- High contrast sci-fi
- Handheld documentary

Add data-nm-section="visual-bible-system"

--------------------------------

5) “Perfect for” checklist

Keep the checklist format but ensure labels are parallel and concise:

- Short films and micro-cinema
- Trailers and teasers
- Pilot episodes and proof-of-concepts
- Experimental storytelling
- Interactive fiction
- Music video narratives

Add data-nm-section="perfect-for-creators"

--------------------------------

6) Final CTA section

Replace the generic ending with a strong close.

Heading:
"Ready to bring your story to life?"

Subcopy (1 sentence):
"Build an interactive story experience your audience can explore, not just watch."

CTAs:
- Primary button:
  Text: "Build a Story Experience"
  data-nm-cta="build-story-experience-footer"

- Secondary text link:
  Text: "Browse examples"
  data-nm-cta="browse-examples"

--------------------------------

7) UI and UX polish (apply throughout page)

- Increase paragraph text contrast slightly for mobile readability.
- Ensure consistent vertical spacing between sections.
- Prevent sticky header overlap with headings (use scroll-margin-top if needed).
- Ensure all buttons meet mobile tap target standards.
- Maintain one clear primary CTA per section.

--------------------------------

Implementation notes
- Prefer updating the existing page component rather than creating a new one.
- Reuse existing Card, Section, and Button components.
- Add data-nm-section attributes to all major sections.
- Do not introduce new dependencies.

--------------------------------

Output required
1) List the files you changed.
2) Paste the final implemented copy blocks for review.
3) Confirm that routing, auth, and global navigation remain unaffected.
