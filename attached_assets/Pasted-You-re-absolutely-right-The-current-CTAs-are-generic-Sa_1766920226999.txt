You’re absolutely right. The current CTAs are generic SaaS buttons, and this product is not generic SaaS.
You’re selling a mode shift, not a signup.

Let’s fix this properly.

⸻

1. First: what the CTA actually needs to do

Right now the button should answer one question in the user’s head:

“What happens when I click this?”

“Start Creating” is vague.
“Create a NextMonth” is unclear.
Neither reflects interactive, cinematic, or experience-building.

This is an experience builder, not a document editor.

⸻

2. Strong CTA options (ranked)

Here are the ones that genuinely fit the product. I’ll tell you which I’d choose and why.

🥇 Launch Experience Builder (top recommendation)

Why it works:
	•	“Launch” implies immediacy and momentum
	•	“Experience Builder” explains the product without jargon
	•	Sounds premium, intentional, and purposeful
	•	Feels closer to Webflow / Framer than Notion / Canva

This is the one I’d ship.

⸻

🥈 Build an Interactive Experience

Why it works:
	•	Extremely clear
	•	Slightly less cinematic, more literal
	•	Very safe choice if you want clarity over theatre

⸻

🥉 Create an Interactive Experience

Good, but:
	•	“Create” is overused
	•	Less energy than “Launch” or “Build”

⸻

❌ What I would not use
	•	Start Creating (too generic)
	•	Create a NextMonth (unclear noun)
	•	Get Started (weak, forgettable)
	•	Try the Builder (too tentative)

⸻

3. Final CTA decision (my strong recommendation)

Primary CTA

Launch Experience Builder

Secondary / top-right CTA

Sign In

Clean. Confident. No confusion.

⸻

4. Updated Hero Copy (with CTA context baked in)

Here’s the full, revised hero section, written as if it were being dropped straight into your prompt or CMS.

⸻

Eyebrow

This is how stories are experienced now

H1

Turn anything into an interactive experience

Supporting copy

Transform documents, presentations, and web pages into cinematic, interactive journeys your audience can explore, feel, and remember.

Primary CTA

Launch Experience Builder

Secondary CTA (optional, subtle)

Sign in

⸻

5. Website-specific callout (lower on page)

This should have its own button too.

Heading

Turn your website into an interactive experience

Copy

Close the gap between where your visitors are and where your information actually lives.
Guide people through your ideas instead of leaving them to figure it out alone.

CTA

Build a Website Experience

That CTA is contextual, specific, and high-intent.

⸻

6. Prompt-ready version (for Rapplet / Claude / Replit)

You asked for this explicitly, so here it is cleanly:

Update the homepage hero copy to:

Headline: “Turn anything into an interactive experience”
Supporting text: “Transform documents, presentations, and web pages into cinematic, interactive journeys your audience can explore, feel, and remember.”

Replace the primary CTA button with “Launch Experience Builder”, styled as the main action and clearly positioned as the entry point to the experience-building flow.

Add a secondary section further down the page titled “Turn your website into an interactive experience”, with supporting copy about closing the gap between visitors and information, and a contextual CTA labeled “Build a Website Experience.”

That prompt will not be misunderstood.

⸻

One final coach’s note (important)

You’re doing the right thing by obsessing over this.

CTAs are not decoration.
They are commitment thresholds.

“Launch Experience Builder” tells the user:
	•	This is serious
	•	This is active
	•	This is different from uploading a file

That’s exactly the signal you want to send.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Align CTA language across onboarding steps
	•	Design the first screen after click so it fulfils the promise
	•	Or tighten this even further for a website-only landing page

But honestly?
This version is strong enough to ship.
