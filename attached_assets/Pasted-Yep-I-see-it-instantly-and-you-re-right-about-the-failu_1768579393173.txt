Yep. I see it instantly, and you’re right about the failure mode.

What’s happening (most likely) is your ingestion logic now has a “specialist detection” step (or a new canonical “character” type), and it’s reclassifying Marco as a Specialist/Avatar because he looks like “an expert persona”. Then the runtime tries to “help” by inserting a generic guide specialist instead of using the one you explicitly defined. Result: Marco gets dropped or overwritten.

You fix this by making the system stop guessing and only use explicit user intent.

The rule you want (plain English)
	1.	Project Brief = the source of truth for the default guide/narrator character.
	2.	Specialists / Video Avatars are opt-in only and only exist if the user adds them via UI.
	3.	Ingestion should never “invent” new specialists and never replace the main character with a specialist.

That’s it. Everything else is implementation detail.

The model you should use in the product

A) Traditional AI Character (always allowed, always from brief)

Call this one of:
	•	Primary Guide
	•	Narrator
	•	Main AI Character (your existing wording is fine)

This is Marco. He is part of the ICE’s core voice.

B) Video Avatar (optional, user-added only)

This is a different card type, not a “character replacement”.

Suggested name:
	•	Video Avatar (best, simple)
Alternative:
	•	Avatar Clip (also clear)
Avoid calling it “specialist” in the UI if it keeps causing this confusion.

⸻

UI change (exactly what you described, but tighter)

In the “Add Character” (or “Add AI”) area, split it into two panels:

Panel 1: Main AI Character
	•	Title: Main AI Character
	•	Description: “This is the voice and personality that guides the whole ICE. It appears in checkpoints and narration.”
	•	Fields: name, personality, expertise, voice/tone, visual description (if you use it)

Panel 2: Video Avatar
	•	Title: Video Avatar
	•	Description (short, non-waffly):
“Video Avatars add extra voices to your ICE, like a customer testimonial or a product expert. They appear only on the cards you assign them to.”
	•	Then: Choose type
	•	Customer testimonial
	•	Product expert
	•	Team member / founder message
	•	Case study clip
	•	Other

And crucially:
	•	A “Video Avatar” must require: avatar provider + script/lines + where it appears (cards)

No card assignment = it never appears.

⸻

Data/schema change (this is the real fix)

You need two explicit entities, not one overloaded “character”.

primaryCharacter
	•	single object
	•	always used unless the user deletes it

videoAvatars[]
	•	array
	•	only used if present
	•	each avatar includes a placement rule (card IDs)

And in the card model:
	•	card.presenter (optional) = { type: "primary" | "videoAvatar", id?: string }

Default behaviour:
	•	If card.presenter is missing, it’s implicitly "primary".

This prevents your renderer from “helpfully” choosing someone else.

⸻

Ingestion/parser guardrails (stop the system being clever)

Add these rules to the ingestion step:
	•	If the brief contains “AI Character” or “Name: Chef Marco” → map to primaryCharacter.
	•	Never map brief content into videoAvatars unless the user explicitly created one in UI.
	•	Never auto-create “specialist/guide” personas.
	•	If the ingestion sees “specialist” language in the brief, treat it as descriptive text unless it matches an existing user-created avatar ID.

If you want to keep “specialists” as a concept internally, fine, but make it non-generative unless a user chooses it.

Copy you can use in the UI (ready to paste)

Main AI Character
“This is the primary guide for your ICE. Their tone and personality shape the whole experience, including checkpoints and narration.”

Video Avatar
“Video Avatars add extra voices to your ICE, like customer testimonials, product experts, or founder messages. They only appear on the cards you assign them to.”

Avatar Type helper
	•	Customer Testimonial: “Build trust with a real voice.”
	•	Product Expert: “Add credibility for technical moments.”
	•	Founder Message: “Set vision and tone quickly.”

⸻

Quick sanity test (so you know it’s fixed)
	•	Create pizza ICE with Marco in brief.
	•	Do not add any Video Avatar.
	•	Generate ICE → Marco appears at all checkpoints, zero other presenters appear.
	•	Add a Video Avatar testimonial assigned to card 2.4 only.
	•	Generate ICE → Marco remains everywhere else, avatar appears only on 2.4.

If any generic specialist appears anywhere, you’ve still got auto-insertion happening.

If you send that screenshot, I can tell you exactly where to place the split in the UI so it feels natural (and doesn’t look like a feature dump). But even without it, the principle stands: Primary guide is narrative infrastructure; avatars are optional inserts.
