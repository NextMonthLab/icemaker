Yep. This transcript is exactly the failure mode you’re worried about: they’re “shipping” by creating new pages and flows, then rationalising it afterwards. That fragments Orbit, overwrites your intended patterns, and wastes your investment.

You need to tell Replit two things, very clearly:
	1.	Stop building new Orbit surfaces unless they’re explicitly inside the Orbit Contract.
	2.	Before implementing anything Orbit-related, they must update the Behaviour Contract + Health Dashboard checks so regressions are impossible to miss.

Here’s a message you can paste to Replit that will put them back in lane, without being aggressive, but with proper teeth.

Team – I need you to get on top of Orbit consistency immediately.

The transcript below is the exact failure mode I’m trying to eliminate:
- Features are being implemented in isolation (“I’ll add /orbit/ingest…”) without aligning to the existing Orbit flows.
- Then afterwards we discover it’s fragmented and needs rework.
This is bleeding value and undermining Orbit’s core promise.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES GOING FORWARD (Orbit work):
1) ONE ORBIT EXPERIENCE ONLY
   - Do not create new Orbit routes/pages/flows unless explicitly approved and mapped in the Orbit Behaviour Contract.
   - Orbit ingestion MUST live within the existing Orbit import flow (/orbit/:slug/import) unless we decide otherwise deliberately.
   - No standalone pages that aren’t tied to a specific Orbit context.

2) NO MORE “FEELS DONE” – WE NEED PROOF
   - Before shipping any Orbit feature, you must add/maintain machine-verifiable evidence that the UI behaves as specified.
   - Green/Amber/Red must never be a guess. No false greens.

3) SHIP THE ORBIT BEHAVIOUR HEALTH DASHBOARD FIRST (or at minimum, Phase 1–3)
   This is now a blocking foundation because we’re losing track of what Orbit should do and regressions are slipping through.
   Implement the “Orbit Behaviour Health Dashboard” with:
   - A versioned Orbit Behaviour Contract (30 items to start)
   - Orbit Evidence Protocol (nm_* metadata in responses + client render events)
   - Deterministic checks runner (feature flags, component registry, endpoints, logging)
   - Dashboard UI to show Reds and evidence packs

   If playback runner (Playwright) is not ready yet, those checks MUST remain AMBER, not green.

4) CHANGE CONTROL
   - Any change that alters Orbit UI behaviour must:
     a) update the contract item(s)
     b) ensure evidence markers + render events exist
     c) show proof in the dashboard evidence pack

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
A) Remove fragmentation: integrate the URL ingestion feature into /orbit/:slug/import (CatalogueImport) and remove /orbit/ingest unless I explicitly approve keeping it.
B) Start the Health Dashboard implementation as the top priority. Use the spec I provided (Orbit Behaviour Health Dashboard prompt) as the exact build brief.
C) Provide me with:
   - the contract file location + the first 30 items committed
   - the evidence protocol implementation details (server + client)
   - a screenshot of the Health page with at least 10 deterministic checks showing status + evidence

The priority is not “more features”, it’s Orbit behaving like a coherent, futuristic system every time – and us being able to SEE when it doesn’t.

Why this wording works
	•	It doesn’t argue about the specific mistake, it changes the operating system: no new surfaces, contract-first, evidence-first.
	•	It makes the Health Dashboard a foundation, not a “nice to have”.
	•	It removes their ability to mark things “complete” without proof.

One extra bit of bite (optional, but effective)

If you want to make it even harder for them to drift again, add this line under “Change Control”:

“If a feature cannot be verified by the Health Dashboard, it is not considered shipped.”

If you want, I can also turn this into a shorter “Pinned Rules” message for the top of the Replit project chat, so every new loop starts with the same guardrails.
