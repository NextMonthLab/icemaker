That sounds like the right outcome. If it’s genuinely saving sources, flipping status, and strength + insight gating change immediately, then you’ve just removed the biggest “movie set” risk.

I’d keep it, with a few deliberate adjustments so it feels inevitable, not “feature-y”.

The must-pass checks (if these pass, it’s “good”)
	1.	Submit Quick Setup → refresh the page → sources are still there
	2.	Orbit shows Powered in Orbits + Launchpad + anywhere else consistently (no mixed labels)
	3.	Strength score is non-zero and changes when you add/remove sources
	4.	Insight gating is clearly explained, not confusing (user knows what they unlocked)
	5.	Generate draft after power-up uses the richer insights immediately (no waiting / no stale cache)

If any one of those fails, it will feel broken even if the backend is correct.

The adjustments I’d make (to make it feel smarter and more addictive)

1) Show “Why this score?” in one click

Strength without explanation can feel arbitrary. Add a tiny “How to reach 100” link that opens a simple breakdown:
	•	About page: ✅
	•	Services/Pricing: ✅
	•	FAQ/Contact: ⬜
	•	Socials: ✅✅ (2/4)

This turns the score into a progression system, not a number.

2) Make the tier gating feel like a reward, not a restriction

If you gate insights, avoid “locked” language. Use:
	•	Basic Orbit: “Starter insights (3)”
	•	Powered Orbit: “Full insights (10) + content-ready ideas”

And on the insight list:
	•	A small pill: Powered insights live (subtle glow)

3) Success screen: force the “switch flipped” moment

After submit:
	•	“Orbit powered up”
	•	“Strength: 62/100 (+42)”
	•	“New insights unlocked”
Primary CTA: Go to Launchpad
Secondary: Review sources

That’s the hook.

4) Let them edit sources later (without re-claiming)

Wherever the wizard lives, add a “Edit sources” link for powered orbits. Otherwise people will feel trapped if they made a mistake.

5) Make sure nothing is client-only

Even if it looks perfect:
	•	Confirm Launchpad reads tier/strength from the backend after refresh, not from local state.

One last thing to verify (still important)

On a published experience, does opening the public URL fire ice_open and increment iceViews?

If yes, you’ve closed the loop.
If no, that’s the final missing stitch.

⸻

What I’d do next
	•	Add the strength breakdown UI (small modal)
	•	Add edit sources entry point
	•	Tighten the copy so gating feels like “level up”
	•	Verify the public ice view event increments metrics

If you send one screenshot each of:
	1.	the powered-up success state,
	2.	Launchpad showing strength + gated insights,
	3.	the insight list’s gating message,
…I’ll give you a precise polish pass (wording + hierarchy + “feels premium” tweaks).
