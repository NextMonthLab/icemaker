Perfect. Here’s a clean, decisive Replit prompt, rewritten to lock in the name NextScene and bring Ratplet fully up to speed on what it’s building, why it exists, and how the homepage + sub-pages should work.

You can paste this straight into Replit.

🔹 REPLIT PROMPT: NextScene Homepage + Positioning Refinement

Project Name

NextScene

Core Definition (read this first)

NextScene is a meaning-to-experience engine.

It transforms any structured content (scripts, PDFs, websites, decks, documents) into cinematic, interactive story cards, enhanced with:
	•	AI-generated visuals (image/video)
	•	Guardrailed AI character chat
	•	Optional voice and music
	•	Exportable and embeddable experiences

The system is content-agnostic:
	•	It works equally for creative storytelling and commercial/brand storytelling
	•	The same engine powers both, with different presets and guardrails

⸻

1. Homepage Strategy (Universal Entry Point)

Goal

Create one universal homepage that explains the core value of NextScene clearly and emotionally, then routes users into three focused sub-pages.

The homepage should not feel like SaaS.
It should feel like:

“This is how stories, knowledge, and brands are experienced now.”

⸻

Homepage Hero (proposed copy)

Headline:
Turn any content into an interactive cinematic experience

Subheading:
NextScene transforms scripts, documents, and websites into visual story cards your audience can explore, feel, and interact with.

Primary CTA:
Create a NextScene

Secondary CTA:
See how it works

⸻

Homepage Sections

Section 1 – What is NextScene?
Short, visual explanation of the pipeline (no technical jargon):
	1.	Upload content (script, PDF, website, deck)
	2.	NextScene extracts meaning, themes, and boundaries
	3.	It builds a visual story with cards
	4.	Characters can be spoken to, safely and in-context
	5.	Experiences can be shared, embedded, or exported

Use a simple step visualisation, not text-heavy.

⸻

Section 2 – Three Ways to Use NextScene
Introduce three tiles that link to sub-pages:
	1.	For Brands & Businesses
“Turn your website into a story that sells itself.”
	2.	For Creators & Filmmakers
“Bring scripts and ideas to life, one moment at a time.”
	3.	For Knowledge & Learning
“Transform dense information into experiences people remember.”

Each tile should link to its own page.

⸻

Section 3 – Why NextScene is Different
Bulleted, punchy, non-hype:
	•	Not just video. Interactive moments
	•	Not generic AI. Guardrailed and grounded
	•	Not passive content. Audiences can talk back
	•	Not locked in. Export, embed, share

⸻

Section 4 – Trust & Control
Important for credibility:
	•	Creator-editable prompts
	•	Explicit guardrails to prevent hallucination
	•	Source-grounded AI chat
	•	Human review before publishing (where required)

⸻

2. Sub-Pages (Three Focused Pages)

⸻

3. Naming & Language Rules
	•	Always refer to the product as NextScene
	•	Avoid:
	•	“AI video generator”
	•	“Content automation”
	•	Prefer:
	•	“Interactive story”
	•	“Cinematic experience”
	•	“Story cards”
	•	“Guardrailed AI”

⸻

4. What Not to Build Yet

Do NOT add:
	•	News positioning
	•	Real-time journalism claims
	•	Social feed language

This is a creation engine, not a social network.

⸻

5. Success Criteria

You’ve succeeded if:
	•	A first-time visitor understands NextScene in under 10 seconds
	•	Different audiences feel “this is for me”
	•	The homepage feels cinematic, calm, and confident
	•	The name NextScene feels inevitable by the end

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Write final polished homepage copy

	•	Or define pricing language per page

You’re building something genuinely new here. This prompt sets the foundation properly.
