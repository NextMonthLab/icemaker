This is a really good instinct again. You’re not nit-picking – you’ve spotted a semantic pricing collision that will confuse users if left as-is.

I’ll answer in three layers:
	1.	What currently doesn’t make sense
	2.	Why it feels unintuitive
	3.	The cleanest fix that preserves all your existing logic

⸻

1️⃣ What doesn’t make sense right now (clearly)

You’re absolutely right to be confused by this pair:
	•	“Your Experience – FAILSAFE – $9.99”
	•	“Full Story – +$13.93”

From a user’s point of view, this creates an immediate question:

“Hang on… what is the $9.99 actually paying for if I still have to pay $13.93 to get the full story?”

Even if you understand it technically, the UI is currently asking the user to do too much mental reconciliation.

So yes – this part is not intuitive yet.

⸻

2️⃣ Why it feels wrong (the real issue)

You currently have three different price concepts, but they’re being presented as if they’re the same kind of thing.

Conceptually, you have:
	1.	Base experience price (the ICE itself)
	2.	Expansion cost (preview → full story)
	3.	Media add-ons (images, video, music, voice)

That’s fine architecturally.

But visually and linguistically, the UI is flattening these into one layer, so the user sees:
	•	A price next to the experience name
	•	Another price to “unlock” the full thing

And their brain goes:

“Am I paying twice for the same thing?”

That’s the friction.

⸻

3️⃣ The clean fix (without re-architecting anything)

You don’t need to change pricing logic.
You need to change what the numbers are describing.

🔧 Fix 1: Rename what $9.99 actually is

Right now:

Your Experience – FAILSAFE – $9.99

This reads like:

“This costs $9.99”

But functionally, that $9.99 is really:

the base ICE creation fee (or base experience fee)

So make that explicit.

Example copy fixes:
	•	Base Experience – $9.99
	•	ICE Creation – $9.99
	•	Experience Setup – $9.99

Any of those immediately answers:

“What is this number?”

⸻

🔧 Fix 2: Make the expansion feel like a delta, not another product

Your Full Story +$13.93 is actually fine mathematically, but the relationship isn’t obvious.

You need to visually and linguistically signal:

“You’re upgrading from preview to full.”

Example microcopy:
	•	Full Story (Upgrade from Preview) – +$13.93
	•	Expand to Full Story (12 scenes) – +$13.93

That framing matters a lot.

⸻

🔧 Fix 3: Show a running subtotal per section

Even before you fix the total accumulation bug, conceptually you want:
	•	Base Experience: $9.99
	•	Story Expansion: +$13.93
	•	Media Options: +$X

Right now, all prices are floating without hierarchy.

A subtle “Section subtotal” line would do wonders.

⸻

4️⃣ Everything else actually does make sense

It’s worth saying this clearly so you don’t overcorrect.

✅ Media options

These are clear, optional, and well-labelled. No issue there.

✅ Download vs Publish

This is excellent. The messaging is clean and honest.

✅ Plan selection

Pro vs Business is clear and well-scoped.

✅ “Sign in to Pay”

Correct, given your earlier decision about login ≠ unlock.

So this is not a broken screen.
It’s a labeling + hierarchy issue, not a structural one.

⸻

5️⃣ The one-sentence diagnosis

If I had to summarise the issue in one line to Repl.it, it would be this:

“The prices are correct, but the meaning of each price isn’t explicit, so users can’t tell what they’re paying for vs what they’re upgrading.”

That’s the heart of it.

⸻

6️⃣ What I’d tell Repl.it next (optional, concise)

If you want a short instruction you can paste, here it is:

The $9.99 shown next to the experience name is ambiguous. It needs to be explicitly labelled as the base experience / ICE creation cost, otherwise it looks like users are being charged twice when they then see the +$13.93 full story expansion.

Please clarify pricing hierarchy (base → expansion → media) through labels or microcopy. No pricing logic change required.

⸻

Bottom line

You’re right to pause.
Your instinct is correct.
Nothing is “wrong” technically, but meaning clarity is slipping at exactly the moment users decide whether to trust you.

Fix the labels and hierarchy, and this screen becomes very strong.
