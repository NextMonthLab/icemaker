That’s the right implementation. Genuinely. This is the kind of “boring correctness” that stops a popular Orbit turning into a data swamp.

Now you’ve got three immediate wins:
	•	Trust: no dodgy products sneaking in with phantom manufacturers.
	•	Operability: warnings are now actionable and machine-readable.
	•	Scale readiness: strict mode + skipped counts = you can automate imports without silent rot.

Now the next step is to turn this into a commercial-quality Orbit experience and a repeatable pipeline.

1) One tweak I’d still make: WARNING vs ERROR

Right now, a missing manufacturer ref is a WARNING. But in strict mode you’re skipping data. That’s functionally more serious than a warning.

I’d do this:
	•	MISSING_MANUFACTURER_REF → severity: "ERROR" (or "CRITICAL")
	•	Keep success: true if you want, but also add:
	•	hasBlockingIssues: true
	•	blockingIssuesCount: 1

Why: it gives you a clean threshold for automation:
	•	if hasBlockingIssues, don’t auto-publish to production Orbits
	•	but still allow import for dev/testing

2) Add a one-line import “health grade”

You’re already 90% there. Add:
	•	qualityScore (0–100)
	•	grade (A/B/C/D)
	•	summary (1 sentence)

Example:
	•	“Imported 2 items. Skipped 1 product due to missing manufacturer reference. Fix manufacturer entity to import fully.”

This will save you ridiculous time later.

3) The commercial layer: make CPAC drive the UI

Now that imports are clean, the Orbit needs to stop feeling like “chat”.

Minimum Smart Glasses front page (CPAC-driven, no AI needed):
	1.	Brand strip (entities with logos / mediaRefs)
	2.	Featured products (products intentTags: featured, best_sellers, new)
	3.	Latest tiles (topic_tiles)
	4.	Start here (core concepts + starter questions)
	5.	Top questions (cached answers if you’ve got them; otherwise “popular prompts”)

If any of those sections has zero items, the UI should auto-hide it (no empty spaces).

4) Monetisation triggers you can ship without extra complexity

You said earlier you want:
	•	Friend of Smart Glasses (newsletter)
	•	Influencer (paid: unlimited chat + ICE creation)
	•	Advertise (sponsor cards)

Now that you’ve got intentTags, you can do this cleanly:

Friend CTA trigger (free)

Trigger when user:
	•	views 2+ tiles OR
	•	clicks 2+ products OR
	•	reads 2+ core concepts

Influencer trigger (paid)

Trigger when user asks:
	•	3+ RECOMMENDATION or COMPARISON intent queries
OR they hit a message limit

Advertise trigger (B2B)

Show persistently but subtly:
	•	“Sponsor a product slot” (only if traffic threshold met, else “Register interest”)

This is the sustainable bit: you monetise behaviour, not vibes.

5) Make “Strict mode” visible in the admin UX

Because you’re skipping records, the admin should show an Import Report panel:
	•	Imported counts
	•	Skipped counts
	•	Warnings table (filter by severity)
	•	“Download fixed seed pack” button (optional later)

If you don’t expose this, you’ll end up hunting logs like a caveman.

6) The one thing I’d ask Rapplet for next

Not more implementation updates. I want proof in the UI.

Ask Rapplet for:
	•	A screenshot (or route) of the Smart Glasses Orbit front page
	•	And the API payload the UI uses to render it

Because the next risk isn’t schema or import. It’s: “we’ve got great data but it’s still underwhelming”.

⸻

If you paste the current front page payload (even a shortened one: entities/products/tiles counts + one example item from each), I’ll tell you exactly what to surface where so it feels like a premium industry hub and not “Orbit Chat with a fancy database”.
