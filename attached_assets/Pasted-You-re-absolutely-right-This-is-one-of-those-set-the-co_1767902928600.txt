You’re absolutely right. This is one of those “set the constitution before you build the city” moments.

If Replit doesn’t understand this distinction as a hard, architectural rule, it will slowly erode it through convenience, shortcuts, or “helpful” abstractions. And once that happens, it’s almost impossible to claw back trust.

So yes: this needs to be written in stone.

Below is a canonical Replit prompt whose sole job is to lock the distinction permanently. This is not a feature prompt. This is a doctrine prompt.

You should treat this as non-negotiable system context for anything Orbit-related going forward.

Replit Canonical Prompt: Orbit Type Doctrine (LOCKED)

Context

We are building a system called Orbits. There are two fundamentally different types of Orbits:
	1.	Standard Orbits
	2.	Industry Orbits

They share the same UI shell and interaction mechanics, but they are governed by different rules of ownership, seeding, neutrality, and monetisation.

This distinction is architectural, philosophical, and non-negotiable.

You must treat this as a hard system constraint.

⸻

Core Doctrine (Must Not Be Violated)

1. Industry Orbits Are Neutral and Unowned
	•	Industry Orbits can NEVER be claimed, owned, or controlled by a user, brand, or organisation.
	•	There is no concept of “Orbit owner” for Industry Orbits.
	•	Industry Orbits are public, neutral intelligence spaces.
	•	They exist independently of user participation.
	•	Their credibility depends on the absence of ownership.

Industry Orbits are inhabited, not owned.

Any design, feature, or data model that implies ownership of an Industry Orbit is invalid and must not be implemented.

⸻

2. Participation ≠ Control (Industry Orbits)

Users may align with Industry Orbits through clearly defined participation modes:
	•	Friend (observer / subscriber)
	•	Influencer (question-shaper / signal contributor)
	•	Sponsor (clearly labelled, non-influential commercial presence)

Important constraints:
	•	Participation never grants editorial control.
	•	Participation never changes answers.
	•	Participation never suppresses competitors.
	•	Participation never reorders intelligence outputs.

Any UI or permission system that blurs participation with control is incorrect.

⸻

3. Standard Orbits Are Claimable and Owned
	•	Standard Orbits may be claimed by a user, brand, or organisation.
	•	Claiming a Standard Orbit grants ownership and editorial control.
	•	Standard Orbits may be opinionated, biased, commercial, or project-specific.
	•	Standard Orbits may fork, remix, or adapt intelligence from Industry Orbits.

Ownership is allowed only for Standard Orbits.

⸻

4. Intelligence Source Differences (Critical)

Industry Orbits
	•	Pre-seeded with foundational knowledge
	•	Continuously updated via monitored pulse feeds (manufacturers, publications, experts)
	•	Detect events even with zero user activity
	•	Learn from user interaction without becoming dependent on it

Standard Orbits
	•	Begin as blank canvases
	•	Intelligence emerges primarily through user interaction
	•	Do not require pulse feeds
	•	May optionally import or reference Industry Orbit insights

These are different intelligence lifecycles and must be modelled separately.

⸻

5. UI Must Be Identical, Semantics Must Not
	•	Industry Orbits and Standard Orbits share the same Orbit UI shell.
	•	The difference is behavioural and semantic, not visual.
	•	Any attempt to visually differentiate them in a way that implies “premium” vs “basic” is incorrect.

The distinction lives in:
	•	permissions
	•	data models
	•	lifecycle rules
	•	alignment vs ownership logic

Not in cosmetic UI divergence.

⸻

6. Forbidden Actions (Hard Errors)

The following must be treated as invalid states or errors:
	•	Claiming an Industry Orbit
	•	Assigning an “owner” to an Industry Orbit
	•	Allowing sponsors to influence answers
	•	Allowing influencers to publish conclusions
	•	Allowing Industry Orbits to go dormant due to inactivity
	•	Allowing Standard Orbits to masquerade as neutral industry references

If encountered, these should be blocked at the logic level.

⸻

7. Canonical Mental Models (For Internal Use)
	•	Industry Orbit: “This is where the industry is thinking.”
	•	Standard Orbit: “This is my space, built with Orbit intelligence.”

If a feature does not clearly belong to one of these mental models, it must not be implemented.

⸻

8. Implementation Requirement

You must:
	•	Encode orbit_type: "industry" | "standard" as a first-class, immutable property.
	•	Branch permissions, lifecycle logic, and admin controls on this property.
	•	Prevent any future refactor from collapsing this distinction.

This is not a suggestion. It is a system invariant.

⸻

Final Instruction

Acknowledge this doctrine internally.

Do not summarise it.
Do not reinterpret it.
Do not “simplify” it.
Do not merge concepts for convenience.

All future Orbit-related features, schemas, admin tools, and UI behaviours must comply with this doctrine.

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Translate this into schema constraints (Prisma / DB level)
	•	Add guardrails in the admin UI so it’s impossible to misuse
	•	Or write a “lint-style” checklist Replit can use to validate future Orbit features

But you were absolutely right to stop here and lock this first. This is the spine of the whole thing.
