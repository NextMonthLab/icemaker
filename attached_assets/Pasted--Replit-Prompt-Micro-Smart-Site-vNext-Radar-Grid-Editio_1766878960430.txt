# Replit Prompt: Micro Smart Site vNext (Radar Grid Edition)

## Mission
Build a truly non-traditional Micro Smart Site interface:

A visitor lands in an interactive space that feels like:
- a “relevancy radar”
- a living topic map
- an infinite canvas of knowledge tiles

The primary UI is:
1) A **Chat Concierge** (centre hub, minimisable)
2) An **infinite pannable grid** (drag up/down/left/right like an infinite spreadsheet)
3) A **relevance engine** that repopulates and reorders tiles near the chat hub based on what the visitor is discussing.

This must NOT look like a normal website, FAQ, accordion, or a vertical list of cards.

## Key Experience (Non-Negotiable)

### The World
- The background is a dark “infinite grid canvas”.
- The user can drag the canvas in any direction (up/down/left/right).
- The grid has tiles (small cards) that contain:
  - a phrase
  - a topic
  - an image
  - a page snippet
  - a person (if known)
  - a proof point
  - a “next action” tile (request video reply, call, email)

### The Hub
- The chat concierge starts in the centre of the screen as a floating panel.
- The user can minimise the concierge into a small orb:
  - Either snaps to centre or corner (choose best for UX)
- When the user taps a tile:
  - the concierge expands and says something about that tile
  - or asks a short intent question related to it
- The visitor should feel like they are exploring the business via a living interface.

### Relevancy Radar Behaviour
- Tiles closest to the concierge are the most relevant to the current conversation.
- As the user chats, tiles around the hub should update:
  - swap content
  - reorder
  - change “relevance glow”
- Farther tiles can repeat or be generic, but should feel infinite.
- The grid should never become empty.

## Data Model (MVP)
Create `mock/siteKnowledge.json` to simulate the “catalogued website”.

Structure:
```json
{
  "brand": { "name": "Progress Accountants", "domain": "progressaccountants.com" },
  "topics": [
    { "id":"t_tax", "label":"Tax strategy", "keywords":["tax","corporation tax","planning"], "type":"topic" },
    { "id":"t_bookkeeping", "label":"Bookkeeping", "keywords":["bookkeeping","records","transactions"], "type":"topic" }
  ],
  "pages": [
    { "id":"p_home", "title":"Home", "url":"https://progressaccountants.com", "summary":"We help businesses feel in control of their finances...", "keywords":["accountants","business"], "type":"page" }
  ],
  "people": [
    { "id":"person_1", "name":"Example Person", "role":"Client Manager", "email":"hello@example.com", "keywords":["contact","help"], "type":"person" }
  ],
  "proof": [
    { "id":"proof_1", "label":"Client stories", "summary":"Examples of results and testimonials", "keywords":["case study","testimonial"], "type":"proof" }
  ],
  "actions": [
    { "id":"a_video_reply", "label":"Request a video reply", "summary":"Get a short personalised video response", "keywords":["video","reply"], "type":"action" }
  ]
}
