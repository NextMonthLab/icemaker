## Replit Prompt (Raptor): Add “Origins / About the Founder” Page to Footer Menu

Goal
We want to add a quiet, credibility-focused page to IceMaker that gives context about who is behind the product and why it exists. This is NOT a fundraising or investor pitch page. It is a low-key trust and legitimacy signal for sophisticated users, partners, and future strategic conversations.

This should feel intentional, understated, and premium.

Scope
Small, contained change:
- Add a new page
- Add a footer link
- No changes to core product flows

Do not introduce calls to action around funding, pricing, or decks.

---

A) Footer Navigation Update

Add a new footer link:
- Label: **“Origins”** (preferred)
  - Alternative acceptable label if needed: “About the Founder”

Placement:
- Footer only
- Near links like About / Legal / Privacy (not in main header navigation)

The link should route to a new static page.

---

B) New Page: “Origins”

Create a new page route, e.g.:
- `/origins`
- `/about-founder` (only if routing conventions require it)

Page intent:
- Explain *why IceMaker exists*
- Provide light founder context
- Signal long-term thinking and seriousness
- Avoid sales, hype, or fundraising language

---

C) Content Structure (simple + elegant)

1) Page title
- “Origins”
- Optional subtitle:
  “Why IceMaker exists”

2) Opening section (short narrative)
- A concise, human explanation of:
  - The motivation behind IceMaker
  - The intersection of storytelling, technology, and interactivity
  - Why interactive cinematic experiences matter

Tone:
- Calm
- Thoughtful
- Confident
- No buzzwords

3) About the Founder (high-signal, brief)
- One short section introducing the founder
- Focus on:
  - Background in filmmaking and storytelling
  - Experience building real systems and products
  - Why this combination led naturally to IceMaker

Avoid:
- Full CV
- Long timelines
- Overly personal details

4) Forward-looking closing line (important)
Include a single, restrained sentence along the lines of:
- IceMaker is being built deliberately, with a focus on quality and long-term value.
- Strategic conversations are welcome when the timing is right.

This is not a CTA. No buttons required.

---

D) Design & UX Guidance

- Keep layout clean and minimal
- Text-first page
- No heavy graphics required
- Must feel consistent with IceMaker’s visual language
- Mobile-friendly by default

---

E) Technical Notes

- Static content is fine (no CMS required at this stage)
- Easy to edit later as the product evolves
- No analytics or tracking changes required

---

Acceptance Criteria

1) A new “Origins” (or equivalent) page exists and is accessible from the footer.
2) The page feels credible and intentional, not promotional or fundraising-led.
3) No impact on existing IceMaker flows or performance.
4) The page can later evolve into a fuller “About / Investor” page without structural rework.

Notes
This page is about trust and context, not conversion. Keep it subtle.
