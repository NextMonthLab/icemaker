You’re not asking too much. You’re asking for the right thing, but the system is currently solving the wrong problem.

What you’re seeing right now is exactly what happens when a system thinks “title pack = font preset” instead of “title pack = layout + motion system”.

I’ll be very straight with you, because this is an inflection point.

⸻

The core diagnosis (this is the truth)

Replit is currently only swapping typography tokens, not swapping compositions.

That’s why:
	•	Every card feels the same
	•	Only the font changes
	•	Positioning never moves
	•	The “grunge” pack half-glitches (a box flashes then disappears)
	•	It feels nothing like CapCut

This is not a rendering bug.
It’s a mental model bug.

Right now, the system is doing this:

“Here is one text container.
Change the font family and maybe colour.
Done.”

CapCut does this instead:

“Here is an entirely different mini layout engine for this title.”

⸻

Why CapCut-style titles feel dramatically different

CapCut titles are not fonts.

They are:
	•	Different bounding boxes
	•	Different anchor points
	•	Different text hierarchy
	•	Different background geometry
	•	Different layer stacks
	•	Different entry/exit motion

When you switch packs in CapCut, you’re not styling text.
You’re swapping a scene blueprint.

⸻

What’s going wrong technically (very likely)

Based on the behaviour you described and the screenshots:

1. Single persistent text container

There is almost certainly one canonical text layer being reused for all packs.

So:
	•	x, y, width, alignment never change
	•	Only font-family updates
	•	Any pack-specific shapes briefly appear, then get garbage-collected or overridden

That flickering grunge box you saw?
That’s a secondary layer being injected, then immediately removed by the layout normaliser.

In other words:
The system is “helpfully” snapping everything back to the default layout.

⸻

2. Packs are treated as style, not structure

Replit is likely doing something like:

applyTitlePack(pack) {
  text.font = pack.font
  text.color = pack.color
}

Instead of:

applyTitlePack(pack) {
  destroyCurrentTitleGroup()
  instantiate(pack.layoutBlueprint)
  bindTextToSlots()
}

That difference is everything.

⸻

The mindset shift you need to force through

You need to tell Replit this sentence (almost verbatim):

A title pack is not a font preset.
A title pack is a layout prefab with its own geometry, layers, and motion.

Until that clicks, you will keep getting “same card, different font”.

⸻

The correct architectural approach (this is the fix)

1. Title packs must be prefab layouts

Each pack should define:
	•	One or more text slots
	•	headline
	•	subline (optional)
	•	One or more graphic layers
	•	block
	•	underline
	•	tape
	•	pill
	•	slash
	•	Absolute or relative positioning
	•	Z-order
	•	Entry animation

When a pack is selected:
	•	The previous title group is destroyed
	•	A new title group is mounted

No inheritance. No mutation. Full swap.

⸻

2. Positioning must be pack-owned

Right now positioning is global.

Instead:
	•	Each pack owns its own safe zones
	•	Example:
	•	Cinematic: bottom-centre, wide, calm
	•	Hyper: mid-frame, angled, aggressive
	•	Grunge: top-left, rough margins
	•	Editorial: lower-third, tight leading

If the text never moves, the pack will never feel different. Full stop.

⸻

3. Motion is part of identity, not decoration

CapCut titles feel alive because:
	•	Text doesn’t just appear
	•	It arrives

Even simple motion is enough:
	•	Fade + slight rise
	•	Slide + ease-out
	•	Scale from 98% → 100%

If Replit is trying to animate only opacity on the same layer, you’ll never get the effect you want.

⸻

Why the “grunge glitch” happened (important clue)

That half-appearing box is a good sign.

It means:
	•	Replit attempted to add a background shape
	•	The rendering system then:
	•	Either reflowed text
	•	Or re-applied a normalisation pass
	•	Or reconciled against a single canonical layout

So the system currently:
	•	Does not expect multiple layered title elements
	•	Actively collapses them back into “just text”

That confirms the diagnosis.

⸻

Are you asking too much?

No.

You’re asking for:
	•	5–6 prefab title layouts
	•	Swapped at render time
	•	With deterministic placement

This is basic motion-graphics architecture, not bleeding edge.

The only reason it feels hard is because the current system was built for static captions, not designed titles.

⸻

The exact instruction I’d give Replit next

If you want something you can literally paste:

We need to reframe title packs as layout prefabs, not font styles.
Each title pack must define its own text containers, background shapes, positioning, and animations.
Selecting a pack should destroy the previous title group and mount a new group from the pack’s blueprint.
Positioning, alignment, and geometry must change per pack – otherwise packs will feel identical.
The current behaviour (same layout, different font) is insufficient and not the intended outcome.

⸻

One last reassurance (important)

What you’re chasing here – that “oh shit, this looks like TikTok-native content” feeling – does not come from AI.

It comes from:
	•	Opinionated layouts
	•	Constraints
	•	Fewer choices, better defaults

You’ve absolutely clocked the missing piece of ICE.

You’re not asking for magic.
You’re asking for designed systems instead of styled text.

If you want, next step I can:
	•	Design one full title pack spec (positions, layers, motion) so Replit has no wiggle room
	•	Or help you decide which single pack to perfect first so the product instantly “clicks”
