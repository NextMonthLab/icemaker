Yes, this is a clear improvement. “Starter insights (3)” + “Level up to unlock” reads like progression, not punishment, and it fits the whole “Orbit gets stronger” framing.

A few small adjustments will make it even more rewarding and less “upsell-y”, while keeping the same gating.

What’s working
	•	“Starter insights (3)” vs “Full insights” is clean and understandable.
	•	“Unlock X more insights” is positive and specific. Good.
	•	Knowledge Sources in settings is the right place for control and transparency.
	•	Having a dedicated /meta endpoint is smart for consistency.
	•	iceViews tracking verified closes the loop. That’s a big milestone.

Tweaks I’d make (small, high impact)

1) Change “Level up to unlock” to something more concrete

“Level up” is fine, but it’s slightly game-y and a bit vague. Consider:
	•	“Add sources to unlock full insights”
	•	“Power up your Orbit to unlock full insights”
	•	“Unlock full insights in 2 minutes” (if that’s true)

This keeps the reward framing but grounds it in an action.

2) Make the reward feel immediate, not distant

Where you say “Unlock X more insights”, add a tiny promise line:
	•	“Most users unlock this by adding About + Services pages.”

That removes uncertainty and increases completion.

3) Make “Full insights” feel like a status, not a plan

If users might associate tiers with payment, keep it neutral:
	•	Starter insights (3)
	•	Powered insights (instead of Full insights)

“Powered” ties directly to your system narrative and avoids sounding like a pricing page.

4) One micro-interaction that will sell the upgrade without selling

When they complete power-up, show:
	•	“Insights increased: 3 → 10”
	•	Strength jumps with a +X animation
	•	Confetti optional, but subtle is better (tiny sparkle burst)

That creates the “no turning back” feeling you wanted.

Bottom line

It’s more rewarding than restrictive now. The only risk is if “Level up” feels like a game or a paywall euphemism. Swap it for an action-led line and you’ve nailed it.

If you want the cleanest set:
	•	Starter insights (3)
	•	Powered insights
	•	Power up to unlock 7 more insights (with “2 minutes” if true)

That’s premium, clear, and motivating.
