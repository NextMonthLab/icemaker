Here you go, Rob, as a Replit prompt you can paste in. After that I’ll answer the tile movement idea properly (short version: yes, but do it like “space dust”, not like a washing machine).

Replit Prompt: Universal Orbit UI Shell + Subtle Tile Motion + Intent Reordering

Build Context
We have multiple Orbit pages (routes like /orbit/[slug]). Any UI improvements must apply universally to all Orbits, not just one topic. We need to refactor the Orbit experience into a shared, reusable “Orbit Shell” component, then layer orbit-specific content (title, starter tiles, CTAs) via a config object or API payload.

Non-negotiables
	•	Do not rebuild the product. This is a refactor and enhancement only.
	•	Keep the existing Orbit architecture, data flow, and styling system wherever possible.
	•	Any visual/interaction improvements must be global and automatically applied to every Orbit route.
	•	Orbit-specific copy and tiles should come only from orbit config/data.

Goals
	1.	Create a universal OrbitShell UI used by every Orbit.
	2.	Improve the “first 5 seconds” experience: stronger intro, proof-of-life signal, clearer tile affordance.
	3.	Add subtle, tasteful “alive” motion to tiles at rest (very light drift/sway).
	4.	Add an optional “intent gravity” mode: when the user clicks a tile or asks a question, tiles re-rank and gently reflow so the most relevant topics float closer to the centre (or primary focal area).
	5.	Make sure this motion is accessible, respects reduced-motion settings, and never harms performance.

Implementation Requirements

A) OrbitShell (Global Component)
Create a reusable component, eg:
	•	OrbitShell.tsx (or equivalent)
Responsibilities:
	•	Renders universal Orbit chat UI (header/title, intro, input bar, send button)
	•	Renders tile canvas behind or around the chat UI (existing tile system)
	•	Accepts orbit data as props:
	•	orbitTitle
	•	orbitSlug
	•	starterTiles (array)
	•	ctas (optional array)
	•	uiFlags (proof-of-life on/off, motion on/off, etc.)

All orbit routes should use OrbitShell, not their own duplicated UI.

B) Orbit Config Contract
Create a contract for orbit-specific content, eg:
	•	orbits.config.ts or API payload shape
Fields:
	•	slug
	•	title
	•	starterTiles: { id, label, sublabel?, intentTags?, priority?, type? }[]
	•	ctas?: { id, label, type, href?, action? }[] (optional)
	•	uiOverrides?: { accent?, disableMotion?, disableIntentGravity? } (optional, default global)

Ensure the UI defaults are global and consistent. Orbits may only override if explicitly allowed.

C) Global UI Improvements (Applied to All Orbits)
	1.	Replace passive intro copy with an “alive” template:

	•	Example template: “This Orbit tracks what people are asking about {topic}. Tap a tile, or ask your own question.”

	2.	Add a single proof-of-life indicator (only if we have truthful data). Options:

	•	“Trending now”
	•	“Updated recently”
	•	“Popular questions”
If we do not have real metrics, do not fake numbers. Use a generic signal like “Trending now” without stats.

	3.	Tile metadata badges (global styling):

	•	Show small badge labels if available: “Trending”, “New”, “Debated”, “Most saved”
	•	If no data exists, fall back to none.

D) Subtle Tile Motion (Ambient Drift)
Add extremely subtle motion so tiles feel alive when idle:
	•	Use a low-amplitude, slow animation (drift/sway)
	•	Must not cause motion sickness
	•	Must be GPU-friendly (transform/translate only, no layout thrash)
	•	Must pause or reduce when:
	•	prefers-reduced-motion is enabled
	•	user is actively dragging/scrolling
	•	device is low power (optional)
Implementation options:
	•	CSS keyframes on transforms for each tile with slight randomised phase/offset
	•	Or requestAnimationFrame with per-tile noise offsets (Perlin/simple sine) but keep it light

E) Intent Gravity Reordering (On Interaction)
When a user clicks a tile or submits a question:
	1.	Determine an “intent vector”:

	•	If tile clicked: use its intentTags / id
	•	If question asked: basic keyword match against tile tags/labels (lightweight heuristic is fine for now)

	2.	Compute relevance scores for all tiles based on shared tags/keywords.
	3.	Animate tiles to new positions so the most relevant tiles move closer to the primary focal zone (near the chat window centre or a designated anchor point).
	4.	The movement must be smooth and readable:

	•	Use spring-like transitions (Framer Motion allowed if already present, otherwise CSS transitions)
	•	Do not teleport tiles
	•	Avoid overlaps (use existing layout rules if any; otherwise implement simple collision avoidance or grid snap)

	5.	After a timeout (eg 10–20 seconds) or on next interaction, either:

	•	Keep the new arrangement (preferred, feels intelligent)
	•	Or slowly relax back to a baseline arrangement

Important: “reorder” should feel like gravity, not sorting a list. It’s a spatial reflow, not a shuffle.

F) Performance + Accessibility
	•	Must hit 60fps on modern phones.
	•	Avoid expensive reflows; prefer transforms.
	•	Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
	•	Ensure tiles remain tappable with correct hit targets.
	•	Do not block main thread with heavy physics. Keep it simple.

Deliverables
	1.	Refactor: all orbit routes now render OrbitShell.
	2.	Orbit config system created and used.
	3.	Ambient drift motion implemented globally with reduced-motion support.
	4.	Intent gravity reordering implemented on tile click and question submit.
	5.	Minimal documentation in code comments explaining:

	•	where to add new orbits
	•	how to add intent tags
	•	how to tune motion intensity safely

Testing Checklist
	•	Check at least 3 different orbit slugs render correctly and identically (except content).
	•	Confirm motion is subtle and not distracting.
	•	Confirm reduced-motion disables animations.
	•	Confirm tapping tiles still works reliably.
	•	Confirm reordering animation is smooth and doesn’t overlap or jitter.
	•	Confirm mobile performance remains strong.

My take on the “subtle movement + gravity reordering” idea

Yes. It’s a strong move because it makes the UI feel like it has a pulse, which is exactly what Orbits should feel like.

But here’s the trap: too much motion makes it feel gimmicky and cheap. You want Interstellar, not screensaver from a 2006 office PC.

The right approach
	•	Ambient drift should be barely noticeable until you stop and stare.
	•	Reordering should only happen for a reason (a click, a question, a “new intent” signal).
	•	Movement should feel like:
	•	“things are being pulled into relevance”
	•	not “the app is rearranging itself for fun”

A solid default behaviour
	•	Idle: 1–3px drift, 8–18 second cycles, slightly randomised per tile.
	•	Interaction: tiles within the user’s intent cluster glide 20–60px closer to the focal zone.
	•	Non-relevant tiles drift slightly outward, but never disappear or fly off.

One important rule

If the tiles move, they must still feel stable enough to tap. If a user goes to tap and the tile slides away, you’ll make people irrationally angry.

If you want, next I can give you:
	•	the exact motion parameters to use (safe ranges)
	•	a simple scoring heuristic for relevance (without AI calls)
	•	and a “don’t be annoying” set of UX constraints for motion

But the prompt above is enough for Replit to start implementing cleanly.
