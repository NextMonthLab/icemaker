PROMPT: Build NextMonth category discovery + Orbit Q&A library for “Smart Glasses” with ethical monetisation, shareable answer cards, and cost-controlled static responses.

CONTEXT
We are building a category experience for NextMonth at /smartglasses. It should feel like:
- A discovery page (SEO-friendly, educational)
- An interactive audit (maps user needs to category fits, not brand picks)
- An Orbit Q&A library (popular questions with stored answers and voting)
- A conversion layer with three CTAs:
  1) Become a Friend (free newsletter)
  2) Become an Influencer (paid subscription: deep chat + ICE Maker for SmartGlasses)
  3) Advertise (sponsored display placements, clearly labelled, not affecting editorial)

CRITICAL INTEGRITY RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1) Editorial content must be neutral and not influenced by paid placements.
2) Sponsored content must be clearly labelled “Sponsored” and appear only in the commercial section.
3) If sponsored products are ever shown in a chat or comparison, they must still be labelled “Sponsored”.
4) No long dash characters in copy (do not use “—”). Use normal hyphens if needed.
5) Use UK English spelling.

ROUTES
- /smartglasses                     -> main discovery page
- /smartglasses/partners            -> vendor interest page (advertise here)
Optional (placeholders are fine):
- /smartglasses/friend              -> newsletter signup page (or modal)
- /smartglasses/influencer          -> influencer subscription upsell page

TECH ASSUMPTIONS
- React + Vite frontend
- Express backend (server/routes.ts)
- TypeScript
- Use React Query for fetching API data with 5-minute stale time

HIGH LEVEL GOAL
Keep AI costs low by serving popular questions and answers from a static library first.
Only generate a new answer when:
- the question has no stored answer
- the stored answer is stale/outdated
- the user asks a follow-up requiring personalised context
For this scaffold, implement the library and voting; the AI generation can be mocked as “Generate new answer” (admin/dev button).

PAGE REQUIREMENTS: /smartglasses
Build a clean, modern page with these sections:

1) HERO
Title: Smart Glasses
Subtitle: Understand the tech, compare options, and stay ahead of what’s next.
Primary CTA: Start the Smart Glasses Audit (scroll to audit)
Secondary CTA: Explore popular questions (scroll to Q&A)
Trust note under CTAs:
"Editorial guidance is neutral. Sponsored placements are clearly labelled."

Add three CTA buttons somewhere prominent (hero or a CTA band under hero):
- Become a Friend (free)
- Become an Influencer (paid)
- Advertise here (sponsored display)

2) QUICK EXPLAINERS GRID (editorial)
6 tiles, educational and neutral. Example titles:
- What smart glasses are
- Smart glasses vs AR glasses
- Best for creators (what to look for)
- Comfort, battery and fit
- Privacy and recording etiquette
- What to expect at different budgets

3) THE AUDIT (editorial, interactive)
A step-by-step wizard that asks:
- Budget range: under £300, £300-£600, £600-£1,200, £1,200+
- Primary goal: content creation, fitness, commuting, work, accessibility, experimenting
- Must-have features (multi-select): camera, open-ear audio, AR display, prescription support, long battery, lightweight
- Privacy comfort: low, medium, high
- Phone ecosystem: iPhone, Android, mixed
- Optional: already wear glasses? yes/no

Audit output:
- Profile summary (short paragraph)
- Top considerations (bullets)
- Category fits (cards), with matchScore 0-100, for example:
  - Camera-first creator glasses
  - Audio-first everyday glasses
  - True AR display glasses
  - Accessibility and assistive glasses
  - Enterprise workflow glasses

IMPORTANT: Audit output must not recommend specific brands.
Below results show two CTAs:
- Ask the Orbit about my results (opens Q&A/chat panel, free limited)
- Unlock Influencer Mode (paid upsell)

4) ORBIT Q&A LIBRARY (editorial but powered by stored answers)
This is the key cost-control feature.

Display:
- A list of 8-12 popular questions (from API)
- Clicking a question opens its stored answers as “Answer cards”

Answer cards must include:
- Answer text (stored)
- Source label (eg “Editorial”)
- Freshness label: “Updated: <date>”
- Voting: 👍 Helpful, 👎 Not helpful
- Share button: “Share”
- Optional button: “Ask a follow-up” (free limited)

Share button behaviour:
- It generates a shareable link that points to NextMonth, not the vendor.
- It should share a URL like:
  /smartglasses?qa=<questionId>&answer=<answerId>
- When visited, the page scrolls to that answer card and highlights it.
- If the answer card references a product, the product link is secondary (a button inside the card), but the shared link always brings people back to NextMonth first.

Voting logic:
- 👍 increments upvotes
- 👎 increments downvotes
- Answers should be ranked by a simple score (upvotes - downvotes), and then by recency.
- Add a small note: “Help improve this Orbit by voting.”

Free usage limit (mock):
- Free users can open the Q&A and ask follow-ups up to 5 messages per day (store count in localStorage).
- Influencer subscription removes the limit (mock with a dev toggle).

5) FRIEND OF SMART GLASSES (free CTA)
A section that explains:
"Get the latest Smart Glasses insights and news in a simple newsletter."
CTA: Become a Friend (opens signup form or navigates to /smartglasses/friend)

6) INFLUENCER MODE (paid CTA)
A section explaining:
- Unlimited deep chat (category-specific)
- Save briefs and talking points
- Create Smart Glasses ICE packs: hooks, scripts, captions, comparison formats, posting plans
CTA: Become an Influencer (go to /smartglasses/influencer)

7) ADVERTISE HERE (commercial CTA)
A short section explaining:
- Display-only sponsored placements
- Clearly labelled
- Does not affect editorial guidance
CTA: Advertise here (go to /smartglasses/partners)

8) SPONSORED DISPLAY SECTION (commercial, visually distinct, bottom of page)
Title: Sponsored products
Subtitle:
"Paid placements from selected providers. These do not affect editorial guidance."

Render 6-12 product cards from API:
- name
- pitch
- priceRange
- tags
- sponsored badge must be visible when sponsored=true
Buttons:
- View details (detailsUrl if present)
- Add to comparison (can be mocked)

IMPORTANT:
For scaffolding, do not mark real-world brand products as sponsored in mock data.
Use placeholder/fictitious product names for sponsored=true to avoid confusion.

A small text link at the end:
"Want your product featured here?" -> /smartglasses/partners

PARTNERS PAGE: /smartglasses/partners
Simple vendor interest form:
- Name (required)
- Company (required)
- Product name (required)
- Website URL (required)
- Email (required)
Submit -> POST /api/smartglasses/partner-inquiry
Show success message: “Thanks. We will be in touch within 2 working days.”

DATA TYPES
Create a types file for SmartGlasses including:

- TrendingQuestion: id, question, heat (1-100), updatedAt
- StoredAnswer: id, questionId, answer, sourceType ('editorial'|'community'), updatedAt, upvotes, downvotes, productRefs?[]
- ProductRef: id, name, detailsUrl (optional), sponsored (boolean)
- SurfacedProduct: id, name, pitch, priceRange, tags[], sponsored, imageUrl?, detailsUrl?
- PartnerInquiry: name, company, product, website, email

API ENDPOINTS (mocked server)
1) GET /api/smartglasses/questions
Return 8-12 questions with heat and updatedAt.

2) GET /api/smartglasses/answers?questionId=...
Return 2-5 stored answers for that question.
Include upvotes/downvotes and updatedAt.
Include optional productRefs for some answers.

3) POST /api/smartglasses/answers/:answerId/vote
Body: { vote: "up" | "down" }
Update counts in memory (OK for mock). Return updated answer.

4) GET /api/smartglasses/surfaced-products
Return 6-12 products.
Use fictitious names for any sponsored=true products.

5) POST /api/smartglasses/partner-inquiry
Log to console and return success.

OPTIONAL DEV FEATURE (helps validate the model)
Add a small dev-only button in Q&A view:
"Generate new answer (mock)"
When clicked, it appends a new stored answer entry for that question with current timestamp and 0 votes.
This simulates AI generating an answer once, then it being stored for future serving.

- Use React Query for questions, answers, surfaced products.
- 5-minute stale time, cache responses.
