Perfect – thanks for the screenshots. They actually make the problem crystal clear, and you’re 100% right to trust your instincts here.

Let me walk this through cleanly, then I’ll give you a tight, screenshot-aware message you can send to Radplayers.

⸻

What the screenshots prove (objectively)

Screen 1 – Orbit view (working as expected)
	•	You are logged in
	•	The Orbit is claimed
	•	You see:
	•	“Welcome back!”
	•	“Manage your Orbit and view analytics”
	•	CTA: Manage Your Orbit

So far, this communicates:

“This is yours. You can manage it.”

✅ Good.

⸻

Screen 2 – What actually happens when you click it
	•	You’re taken to /hub
	•	You hit a full-page upgrade gate
	•	Primary CTA: Upgrade to Grow
	•	Secondary link: “View your Orbit” (which just loops you back)

This communicates:

“You can’t manage anything unless you pay.”

❌ This is the break.

⸻

The precise UX sin that’s happening

This isn’t just “a bit aggressive”.

This is a mislabelled affordance.

The button says:

Manage Your Orbit

But the behaviour is:

Upgrade or leave

That mismatch is what makes it feel wrong.

If the button said:
	•	“Upgrade to Manage”
	•	or “Unlock Business Hub”

…then fine. But it doesn’t.

Right now, it’s promising ownership, then enforcing permission.

That’s where trust erodes.

⸻

Reconfirming what we agreed (now with precision)

Let’s lock this in very clearly so there’s no ambiguity when you go back to Radplayers.

Free users who have claimed an Orbit should get:

1. A Basic Management View (not the Business Hub)
This can be lightweight, but it must exist.

For example:
	•	Orbit details (name, category, location)
	•	Status: claimed / live
	•	Ability to update basic metadata (even if limited)
	•	Confirmation: “You own this Orbit”

2. Teaser Analytics (read-only)
Not the full Business Hub.

Think:
	•	Total visits (last 30 days)
	•	Total interactions (aggregated)
	•	A simple message like:
“Your Orbit has been discovered this month”

This answers the emotional question:

“Is this doing anything?”

3. Visible but locked premium sections
Inside the view:
	•	“Audience Insights” (locked)
	•	“AI Recommendations” (locked)
	•	“Introductions & Leads” (locked)

Each locked card explains why it matters.

This is desire-driven upsell, not a wall.

⸻

What should be gated by upgrade

The Business Hub itself is a premium space. That’s fine.

So:
	•	/hub = paid
	•	But “Manage Your Orbit” should not deep-link straight into /hub for free users.

Instead:
	•	Free users → Orbit Manager (Lite)
	•	Paid users → Business Hub

⸻

The clean behavioural fix (one sentence)

If an Orbit is claimed but not upgraded, “Manage Your Orbit” should open a free management view, not the Business Hub upgrade screen.

That’s the whole thing.

⸻

Message you can now send to Radplayers (updated, screenshot-aware)

You can paste this as-is:

⸻

I’ve attached screenshots to show the issue clearly.

When logged in as FlashBuzz (boo.flashbuzz.co.uk), the Orbit is already claimed and I see the CTA “Manage Your Orbit”, which implies basic management access.

However, clicking this routes directly to /hub, which is a full upgrade gate (“Upgrade to unlock your Business Hub”), meaning I can’t manage anything at all.

This feels like a hard block and creates a mismatch between the button label and the behaviour.

What we agreed was:
	•	Claimed Orbits should have basic management access on the free tier
	•	Free users should see lightweight / teaser analytics
	•	The Business Hub itself is premium and unlocked via upgrade

“Manage Your Orbit” should not force an upgrade. It should open a basic Orbit management view for free users, with the Business Hub clearly positioned as an upgrade inside that experience.

Can we adjust the routing so:
	•	Free, claimed Orbits → basic management view
	•	Upgraded Orbits → Business Hub

This keeps the upgrade aspirational rather than a hard gate.

⸻

Straight talk, Rob

Your gut is spot on.

This is one of those small-seeming UX decisions that quietly determines whether:
	•	people trust the platform, or
	•	feel like they’ve been bait-and-switched.

You’re protecting the long game here.

If you want next, we can:
	•	Sketch the exact contents of the free Orbit Manager screen
	•	Rewrite the button labels to be bulletproof
	•	Or design the upgrade moment copy so it feels like momentum, not pressure

You’re steering this exactly where it needs to go.
