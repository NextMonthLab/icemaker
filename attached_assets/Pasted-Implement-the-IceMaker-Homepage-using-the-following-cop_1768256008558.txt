TITLE: IceMaker — Interactive experiences from your content

HERO
Headline:
Turn training and enablement content into interactive experiences people actually finish.

Subhead:
IceMaker transforms PDFs, decks, URLs and scripts into scene-based experiences with AI visuals, music, and an on-screen guide that answers questions using only your approved material.

Micro-line (small text):
Not a slideshow. Not a chatbot. Interactive cinematic experiences — grounded, controlled, and built from what you already have.

Primary CTA button:

Secondary CTA:

TRUST / PROOF STRIP (placeholders allowed)
Small heading:
Built for teams who need more than static content

3 bullets:
- Source-grounded answers (no random internet facts)
- Memory across scenes and sessions
- Knowledge boundaries and progressive reveal

PROBLEM SECTION
Heading:
Static content gets skimmed. Interactive content gets completed.

Bullets:
- Compliance and onboarding decks don’t stick — people click through and forget.
- Sales collateral sits unread — prospects want answers, not pages.
- Building engaging training is slow and expensive — even before it needs updating.

SOLUTION OVERVIEW
Heading:
From source material to a guided experience — in minutes.

Short paragraph:
Upload your material once. IceMaker structures it into scenes, generates supporting visuals and pacing, and adds interactive moments where a guide can answer questions without going beyond the source.

4-step mini flow:
1) Ingest your source (PDF, deck, URL, script)
2) Auto-structure into scenes
3) Add an interactive guide with boundaries
4) Publish a link or embed

Lock knowledge to sections, chapters, or scenes. Perfect for compliance and regulated teams.

Card 4 title:
Scene-based structure
Card 4 text:
