Absolutely. Here’s a copy/paste Replit prompt that’s tight, MVP-safe, and very explicit about “desktop-only enhancements” without breaking mobile.

Replit Prompt: Desktop Enhancements for IceMaker Builder Page (Sidebar + Preview Drawer)

Context
We have a page in IceMaker that currently uses a mobile-first stacked layout (actions + cards list). The mobile UX is good and must remain unchanged. On desktop (laptop/large screens) we want to improve usability by adding:
	1.	A desktop-only sticky right sidebar for key Actions (Generate AI Media, Music/Narration, Branding, Advanced Captions, Export/Share).
	2.	A Preview drawer (desktop-only) that can slide in/out and show the selected card preview without forcing a full redesign.

We must implement this as progressive enhancement only. No major refactor. The existing stacked layout remains the primary structure, especially on mobile.

Non-negotiables
	•	Do not break or redesign mobile layout.
	•	Desktop enhancements should activate only from a breakpoint (e.g. lg / min-width: 1024px).
	•	Keep changes isolated to the Builder page components (avoid touching unrelated routes).
	•	Do not change API behaviour or server logic. UI-only.
	•	If any existing components are reused (music controls, branding upload, caption settings), move them into shared components only if it’s low-risk. Otherwise, duplicate minimal UI wrappers and reuse the same underlying components.

Goal UX (Desktop)

Layout
	•	Main content remains a central column with the ICE title + actions header + cards list (as today).
	•	Add a right sidebar that is:
	•	Visible on desktop only
	•	position: sticky; top: <headerHeight> so it stays visible as user scrolls cards
	•	Collapsible (toggle button). Default state: expanded.
	•	Width: ~360–420px (responsive), never shrinking the main column too much.

Sidebar Contents (Actions)

In the sidebar, include these sections in this order:
	1.	Generate AI Media (existing section / button(s))
	2.	Background Music + Narration sliders
	3.	Logo Branding upload
	4.	Advanced Caption Settings (collapsed by default is fine)
	5.	Export Video / Share / Story Tips / Project Bible (existing tabs/actions can be placed as buttons or links)

Important: On desktop, these actions should be available persistently in the sidebar, but they should still exist in the stacked flow for smaller screens.

Preview Drawer (Desktop-only)

Behaviour
	•	Add a “Preview” button near the top (desktop only) and/or a small floating button.
	•	Preview opens a drawer from the right edge (overlaying or pushing the sidebar depending on simplest implementation).
	•	Drawer shows:
	•	Selected card number/title
	•	Media preview (image/video if available, otherwise placeholder)
	•	Caption preview (whatever the system uses)
	•	Drawer must be closeable.
	•	If no card is selected yet, show “Select a card to preview”.

Selection source
	•	When user clicks a card in the list (already used for editing), set selectedCardId in state.
	•	Preview drawer reads from the same selected state.
	•	Do not introduce complex syncing. Keep it simple.

Implementation Guidance
	1.	Identify the Builder page component (the page that contains the stacked actions + cards list).
	2.	Introduce a responsive layout wrapper:
	•	Mobile: current stack
	•	Desktop: grid with grid-template-columns: 1fr 400px (main + sidebar)
	3.	Build BuilderActionsSidebar component:
	•	Receives the existing action components/props
	•	Sticky container
	•	Collapse toggle (persist collapsed state in localStorage is optional, not required)
	4.	Build BuilderPreviewDrawer component:
	•	Controlled via isPreviewOpen and selectedCard
	•	Desktop-only render
	•	Use existing preview components if already exist; otherwise, implement minimal preview UI without new backend work.
	5.	Ensure the existing stacked action blocks are still rendered on mobile and optionally hidden on desktop to avoid duplication. Preferred:
	•	On desktop, hide stacked actions and show them in sidebar.
	•	On mobile, show stacked actions and hide sidebar/drawer.
	6.	Keep styling consistent with current dark UI:
	•	Use existing design tokens / Tailwind classes
	•	Don’t introduce new colour themes
	•	Keep shadows and rounded corners consistent

⸻

Acceptance Criteria
	•	Mobile view looks identical to current behaviour.
	•	Desktop view shows:
	•	Cards list in main column
	•	Sticky right sidebar with the actions
	•	Preview drawer that opens/closes and displays selected card preview
	•	No console errors, no broken navigation.
	•	All existing actions still work as before.

⸻

Output required
	•	Implement the UI changes.
	•	Provide a short summary of:
	•	Which files changed
	•	Where the sidebar and preview drawer are implemented
	•	How to test desktop vs mobile quickly (breakpoint guidance)

If you need to make assumptions about header height for sticky top offset, use a sensible default and match the existing top nav height.
