Yep – that last amendment to Launchpad is a win. The UI now has a single design language (dark surfaces + brand gradient accents) and it’s starting to feel like a real NextMonth OS.

Now: Orbits and Library are the last two “tell-tales” that will give away the old fragmented product if we don’t bring them into the same visual family.

⸻

1) Library page (IceMaker / My Projects) – what’s wrong

In your screenshot, Library still looks like the old IceMaker app wearing the new top nav.

The giveaways
	•	Left sidebar still says IceMaker and has “Dashboard / Create Experience / My Projects”.
	•	The page title is “My Projects” but the global nav says “Library”.
	•	The button styling is still the old pink, not your new brand gradient system.
	•	The whole layout feels like a separate product embedded inside NextMonth.

What to change (simple, high impact)

A. Remove the IceMaker sidebar entirely (or hide it when top nav is present).
Library should be a clean first-class NextMonth page, not a nested tool.

B. Reframe the page as “Library”, not “My Projects”.
Then use tabs inside it:
	•	Drafts
	•	Published
	•	Templates
	•	Downloads (optional)

C. Make the empty state match Launchpad
Instead of “No projects yet”, use:
	•	Headline: Your Library is empty
	•	Sub: Drafts and published experiences will appear here.
	•	Primary CTA: Make an Ice from an insight (takes you to Launchpad, scrolls to Insights)
	•	Secondary CTA: Create from scratch (only if you genuinely support it)

This reinforces the loop instead of sending people into an old IceMaker flow.

D. Rename “New Project” to “New Ice”
And use the same brand gradient button style as Launchpad.

If you only do one thing: kill the IceMaker sidebar. It instantly stops feeling like a separate app.

2) Orbits page (Explore Orbits) – it’s close, but still “old Orbit”

This page is much less broken than Library. The layout is fine, but the styling is still in the “Orbit era”.

The giveaways
	•	The big purple “Claim Your Orbit” block (again, your bugbear).
	•	Sidebar feels like a different system (different icon weight / spacing / emphasis).
	•	The “Explore Orbits” page is more of a marketing landing screen than an admin/product screen.

What to change (keep the layout, update the skin + hierarchy)

A. Make “Claim Your Orbit” a dark card with an accent border
No full purple fill. Same rule as Launchpad.

B. Reframe the page structure
Orbits should feel like:
	•	My Orbits (list)
	•	Claim new Orbit
	•	Orbit Admin (once inside a specific orbit)

So “Explore Orbits” might become “Orbits” and show:
	•	A list/table/grid of orbits
	•	Each orbit tile shows: status (basic/powered), strength score, last updated
	•	Primary CTA: Open Launchpad for that orbit
	•	Secondary CTA: Manage Orbit (goes to admin)

C. Button language should match Launchpad
	•	“Get Started” → Claim Orbit
	•	“Analyze” → Open Intelligence
	•	“Explore” → Open Map

Small words, big cohesion.

The unifying rule across all three pages

Launchpad is the product. Orbits and Library are supporting areas.

So:
	•	Launchpad = action + loop
	•	Orbits = configuration + admin
	•	Library = outcomes (drafts/published)

Right now Launchpad is aligned. Orbits is 70% aligned. Library is 30% aligned.

Your next instruction to Replica (copy/paste)

If you want a clean task for them:
	1.	Library page: remove IceMaker sidebar when global nav exists, rename page to “Library”, add tabs (Drafts/Published/Templates), and update empty state CTAs to push users back to Launchpad loop.
	2.	Orbits page: remove purple fill blocks, convert to dark cards with accent borders, and restructure Orbits home to focus on “My Orbits” + “Claim Orbit” rather than “Explore Orbits” marketing tiles.
	3.	Ensure all CTAs use the brand gradient system consistently (only primary actions get full gradient fill).

If you send me one more screenshot after the Library sidebar is gone and the Orbits purple card is dark-with-accent, I’ll call it: at that point the whole nav will feel like one product, not stitched apps.
