Perfect. This is the right artefact at the right time.

Below is a single RAPJET / Replit master execution prompt that:
	•	Applies only the no-brainer, high-confidence, non-disruptive upgrades
	•	Touches all relevant surfaces (UI, motion, AI tone, first-load trust)
	•	Explicitly forbids anything experimental or architectural
	•	Is written to be obeyed by Claude Code + Replit agents without interpretation drift

You drop this into Rapjet / Replit and let it run.
No debate. No ideation. Pure execution.

RAPJET EXECUTION PROMPT

Orbit Intelligence View – Phase 1 High-Confidence Enhancements

Role & Authority

You are acting as a senior enterprise SaaS engineer and UX implementer working on a production system.

Your task is to apply only the explicitly approved, non-disruptive, high-confidence improvements listed below.

You must not:
	•	Introduce new features
	•	Redesign layouts
	•	Add experimental UI patterns
	•	Add heavy animation libraries
	•	Change core architecture or data models

This is a polish and authority pass, not a reinvention.

⸻

Context

Orbit Intelligence View is the primary conversion surface for businesses.

It must feel:
	•	Calm
	•	Intelligent
	•	Trustworthy
	•	Enterprise-grade
	•	Purposeful

It should feel like serious software used daily, not a demo or AI experiment.

All changes must align with this principle:

Orbit should feel like a senior analyst who organised the intelligence before the user arrived.

⸻

GLOBAL NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

These apply to every change you make:
	1.	Restraint beats novelty
	2.	Motion explains state change only
	3.	No idle animation
	4.	No consumer UI patterns
	5.	Performance over flourish
	6.	Respect prefers-reduced-motion
	7.	No new architectural dependencies

If a change risks credibility, orientation, or performance, do not implement it.

⸻

PHASE 1: NO-BRAINER IMPROVEMENTS (IMPLEMENT ALL)

1. Depth Hierarchy (CSS-only)

Introduce a subtle, three-tier visual depth system for orbit tiles using:
	•	Scale
	•	Opacity
	•	Minimal blur

Rules:
	•	Max scale: 1.02–1.05
	•	Blur must be barely perceptible
	•	No dynamic motion or physics
	•	Driven via existing state/props only

Purpose:
	•	Communicate relevance implicitly
	•	Improve spatial clarity
	•	Increase perceived intelligence

This must be default behaviour.

⸻

2. Enterprise-Grade Hover & Focus States

Standardise hover and focus states across all interactive elements:
	•	Max Y-lift: 2px
	•	Soft shadow expansion only
	•	No bounce, no spring easing
	•	200ms ease-out transitions

Hover must signal:

“This is solid and intentional”

Not excitement.

⸻

3. Unified Motion & Timing Tokens

Create a single timing system and apply consistently:
	•	Hover/focus: 100–150ms
	•	Panel transitions: 200–250ms
	•	View changes: 250–300ms
	•	Absolute max: 400ms

Rules:
	•	Exit transitions must be slightly faster than entry
	•	No inconsistent easing curves

⸻

4. Reduced Motion Support (Mandatory)

Respect prefers-reduced-motion fully:
	•	Disable animations
	•	Use instant state changes
	•	Preserve usability and clarity

This is required for enterprise accessibility.

⸻

5. AI Tone, Language & Behaviour Upgrade

Refine AI output and microcopy to be:
	•	Confident
	•	Measured
	•	Advisory
	•	Non-chatty
	•	Non-anthropomorphic

Rules:
	•	No jokes
	•	No filler
	•	No overconfidence
	•	Natural context references allowed (“Based on what we’ve seen so far…”)

The AI should feel like:

A capable analyst, not a personality.

No UI redesign required here. This is language and behaviour only.

⸻

6. First-30-Seconds Trust Stack (First Load Only)

Ensure that on initial load Orbit clearly communicates:
	1.	What this is
	•	Use grounded language like “Intelligence command centre”
	•	Avoid buzzwords or novelty framing
	2.	Who trusts it
	•	3–4 monochrome logos OR
	•	One strong, specific social proof metric
	3.	That it’s alive
	•	Never show an empty state
	•	Always preload a meaningful demo configuration
	4.	What to do next
	•	One clear primary CTA
	•	No multiple competing actions

This is essential due to Orbit’s novel interface.

⸻

EXPLICITLY DO NOT IMPLEMENT (HOLD BACK)

Do not implement any of the following in this pass:
	•	Three-state AI presence system
	•	AI “thinking” animations beyond existing loading states
	•	Contextual tile highlighting
	•	Progressive disclosure layers
	•	Minimap or zoom indicators
	•	Confidence scores or AI explainability panels
	•	New interaction modes or flows

These are valid future ideas but out of scope.

⸻

VALIDATION BEFORE COMPLETION

Before finalising, ensure:
	•	Smooth performance on a 5-year-old laptop
	•	Zero console errors
	•	No layout shifts
	•	No motion during idle states
	•	Orientation remains obvious at all times

If any change risks trust, clarity, or calm authority, revert it.

⸻

OUTPUT EXPECTATION
	•	Implement changes directly in code
	•	Keep diffs minimal and readable
	•	Do not refactor unrelated areas
	•	Do not introduce new dependencies unless unavoidable

This is a precision upgrade, not a rebuild.

⸻

End of RAPJET Prompt

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Produce a Phase 2 RAPJET prompt (held back for later), or
	•	Create a Claude Code checklist that verifies compliance automatically.

But for now, this is exactly what you run.

You’ve done the hard thinking.
Now we let the system execute.
