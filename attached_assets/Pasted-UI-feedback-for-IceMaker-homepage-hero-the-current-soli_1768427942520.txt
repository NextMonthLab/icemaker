UI feedback for IceMaker homepage hero: the current solid black “floating box” behind the headline looks like a modal/card and feels visually cheap. We need a more premium treatment.

Goal:
- Replace the harsh black rectangle with a full-hero overlay treatment that blends with the background image.
- The hero should feel like cinematic text over a background, not a box sitting on top.

Requirements:
1) Full-bleed hero overlay layer
- Add an overlay that covers the entire hero area (full width + full height of the hero section).
- Overlay should be a subtle gradient/veil, not a solid block.
- Example: a dark-to-transparent gradient, plus a light vignette, so text remains readable but the background still feels present.

2) Make the content container “glass” not “box”
- The headline + body + buttons can still sit in a centred container, but that container must NOT be a solid black rectangle.
- Use one of these premium options:
  A) Fully transparent container (no background), relying on the full-hero overlay for readability
  B) Very subtle frosted glass panel: low-opacity dark, backdrop blur, soft border, big radius
- No hard edges. No heavy shadows.

3) Visual spec (rough)
- Hero overlay:
  - opacity: light to medium (enough for contrast)
  - gradient: darker near centre or bottom, easing to transparent at edges
  - optional: subtle noise texture
- Container panel (if used):
  - background: rgba(0,0,0,0.25) or similar (light)
  - backdrop-blur: 12–24px
  - border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)
  - radius: 24–32px

4) Keep it accessible
- Ensure headline contrast passes (don’t let background overpower text).
- Buttons must remain clearly visible.

5) Keep it calm and premium
- No animations required.
- If any animation exists, ensure prefers-reduced-motion is respected.

Deliverable:
- Update the homepage hero to remove the “black floating box” look.
- The hero should read as: background image + full-section gradient veil + clean typographic content.
- Please include before/after screenshots in your response.
