Got you. You’re right: if we frame it as a “fallback”, it’ll get treated like an edge-case. What you actually want is a first-class cinematic feature: Video Cutaway Continuation.

Here’s a standalone prompt you can paste into Replit.

⸻

Replit Prompt: Implement “Cinematic Continuation” as a Core Feature (Not a Fallback)

Context
We’ve fixed 10-second video generation, but we still need a premium, intentional solution for when narration/dialogue duration exceeds the generated video duration (which will be common). We do not want looping video. We do not want “dead air” visuals. We want a deliberate cinematic technique that makes the experience feel directed.

Feature Name (use this framing in code + UI)

Cinematic Continuation (Cutaway Still)
A purposeful cut from motion to a context-aware still image while narration continues.

⸻

1) Behaviour Requirements (Hard Rules)

A) Never loop video to fill time
	•	The generated video plays once.
	•	No repeating the same clip.

B) When narration continues beyond video end, transition to a continuation still
	•	If narrationDuration > videoDuration then:
	1.	Play video for videoDuration
	2.	Auto-transition (crossfade or clean cut) to continuation still
	3.	Continue audio narration over the still until narration ends

C) This is default ON
	•	It’s not a contingency.
	•	Assume it will be used frequently.
	•	Users shouldn’t need to “discover” it.

⸻

2) Continuation Still Generation (How to create the image)

Inputs (must be used)
	•	The video prompt that generated the clip (primary visual context)
	•	The remaining dialogue/narration text after the video ends (primary narrative context)
	•	Optional: card title / section title / ICE style preset

Output goal

A still image that feels like a motivated cutaway:
	•	Same scene/world
	•	More specific framing
	•	Often a detail shot that matches what’s being talked about

Prompting rules (to improve quality)
	•	Prefer: objects, hands, environment, close-ups, inserts
	•	Avoid: frozen faces as the default continuation (unless explicitly needed)
	•	Keep continuity: lighting/time of day/style should match the video prompt
	•	Style should match the ICE visual style (cinematic, documentary, rustic, etc.)

Examples of good continuation patterns
	•	Wide shot (video) → close-up of key object (still)
	•	Character speaking (video) → desk notes / book / tool / product detail (still)
	•	Exterior establishing (video) → interior detail / signage / texture (still)

⸻

3) UI / Settings (Keep it simple but real)

Default UX
	•	If user selects video for a card, Cinematic Continuation is automatically enabled.

Optional toggle (advanced)
	•	Add a simple toggle in the card media settings:
	•	✅ “Cinematic Continuation (Cutaway Still)”
	•	Description: “After the video ends, we cut to a context-aware still so narration stays visually engaging.”

Visual transition
	•	Implement a subtle crossfade (e.g., 200–400ms) from last video frame → still image, if feasible.
	•	If not feasible, a clean cut is acceptable for MVP.

⸻

4) Implementation Notes (So it actually gets done)

Timing logic
	•	We need a reliable narrationDurationSeconds per card (already exists or can be estimated from TTS metadata).
	•	We need videoDurationSeconds (known: 5/10/etc based on generation).

Asset handling
	•	Store continuation still as a first-class asset on the card, e.g.:
	•	card.media.video
	•	card.media.continuationImage
	•	Ensure exports/rendering include the continuation still section automatically when needed.

Rendering/export behaviour
	•	Timeline for a single card becomes:
	•	Segment 1: video + audio (0 → videoDuration)
	•	Segment 2: continuation still + audio (videoDuration → narrationDuration)
	•	If narrationDuration <= videoDuration: continuation still is not shown (but can still be generated optionally if user wants).

⸻

5) Acceptance Criteria (So we can test fast)
	1.	If narration is 18s and video is 10s:
	•	Video plays once (10s)
	•	Still shows for remaining 8s
	•	Audio runs continuously for full 18s
	•	No looping
	2.	Continuation still visually matches the scene and references the remaining dialogue.
	3.	Feature is on by default and feels intentional in UI copy (not called “fallback”).

⸻

Outcome goal
iSmaker outputs should feel directed and premium: motion to detail cutaways, no repetition, no “filler”. This should be a signature part of the product experience.

⸻

If you want to really brand it (and you probably should), two name options that feel product-y:
	•	Cutaway Mode
	•	Cinematic Continuation

“Fallback” can get in the bin with the other shameful MVP words.
