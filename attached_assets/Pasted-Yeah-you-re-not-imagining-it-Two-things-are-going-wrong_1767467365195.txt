Yeah, you’re not imagining it. Two things are going wrong in those screenshots:

1) You’ve accidentally created a “sticky CTA bar”

In the last screenshot, this bit…

“Ready to see what ICE can do for your business?” + URL field + Create free preview

…is sticking to the top of the viewport while you’re down the page (above “Why businesses choose NextMonth”). That’s almost certainly an unintended position: sticky (Tailwind sticky top-0) sitting on a section wrapper or CTA component.

Result: it feels glitchy, like the page has duplicated its hero.

2) The “section skins” aren’t being applied consistently

Some sections have the new treatment (hero has a faint grid/spotlight, and you’ve got that big purple gradient at the bottom), but other sections are still just “flat black” or have a slightly different background that looks like a mis-applied wrapper (eg the grey-ish band behind “How the free preview works”).

That’s why it feels like something’s “not working” rather than “polished”.

What I’d do (clean fix, not messy)

A) Remove the sticky CTA bar entirely (for now)

Unless you explicitly want a sticky conversion bar, it’s not worth the confusion. It’s reading like a bug.

If you do want a sticky bar later, it should:
	•	Only appear after the hero scrolls out of view (IntersectionObserver)
	•	Be smaller (one line + button), not a mini-form clone
	•	Never compete visually with section headings

B) Make SectionSkin boundaries strict

Every skinned section should be:
	•	relative
	•	overflow-hidden
	•	background layers on ::before/::after with absolute inset-0
	•	pointer-events-none
	•	with a controlled z-index so it doesn’t leak outside its section or sit above content

Right now it looks like at least one skin wrapper is either:
	•	missing overflow-hidden, or
	•	applied to the wrong parent, or
	•	using a background block that isn’t clipped to the section.

C) Reduce the “big purple slab” a touch

It looks good, but the height/padding is excessive so it becomes a whole “scene change” rather than a final CTA.

RATPLID prompt to fix this properly

Paste this into Replit:

RATPLID PROMPT: Fix broken marketing page section skins and remove unintended sticky CTA bar on /for/businesses

Observed issues
1) A mini CTA ("Ready to see what ICE can do…", URL input + Create free preview) is sticking to the top of the viewport when scrolling. This looks accidental and duplicates the hero experience.
2) Section background skins are not applied consistently; some sections look flat black, others have mismatched bands, suggesting skins are leaking outside their intended section boundaries.

Hard requirements
A) Remove unintended sticky CTA behaviour
- Search for any element on /for/businesses using position: sticky (Tailwind `sticky`, `top-0`, `top-*`) or a fixed CTA wrapper.
- Remove sticky/fixed behaviour entirely for now.
- Ensure the preview form only appears in:
  - the hero section, and
  - the final CTA section (if present)
- Do NOT duplicate the preview form as a persistent bar.

B) Make SectionSkin boundaries correct and non-leaky
- For every section that uses a background skin (grid/noise/spotlight/gradient):
  - Ensure the section wrapper is `relative overflow-hidden`
  - Background layers must be inside the section via pseudo-elements or an absolutely positioned child with `inset-0`
  - Background layers must be `pointer-events-none`
  - Background layers must sit behind content (z-index layering correct)
- Prevent any background layer from extending beyond its section.

C) Consistent skin application (business page)
- Hero: orbitGrid + spotlight (subtle)
- "How the free preview works": spotlight (very subtle), no grey banding
- "How businesses use NextMonth": noise + spotlight
- "See ICE in action": noise + faint grid (optional)
- "Why businesses choose NextMonth": spotlight (subtle)
- Final CTA: gradient band, but reduce vertical padding so it doesn’t dominate

D) Tighten final CTA section spacing
- Reduce excessive height/padding so the gradient CTA feels like a strong close, not a full-screen slab.
- Keep readability and button alignment intact on mobile.

Acceptance criteria
- No sticky CTA bar appears at the top during scroll.
- Background textures are clipped per-section and never overlap neighbouring sections.
- Each major section has a distinct but subtle background treatment.
- No layout shifts or new horizontal scrolling introduced.

Deliverable
- Commit the fixes and confirm which component(s) were causing the sticky CTA and background leakage.

If you want the quick “spot the culprit” hint: search the business page for sticky first. That top bar in your screenshot has all the hallmarks of “someone added a sticky conversion strip” and Tailwind happily did what it was told.

Send me the component name/file for /for/businesses and I’ll tell you exactly where I’d expect the bug to be sitting.
